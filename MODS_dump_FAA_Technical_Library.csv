dot:63526,,16-G-007,"A team consisting of The Ohio State University (OSU)\, George Mason University (GMU)\, National Aeronautics and Space Administration Glenn Research Center (NASA-GRC)\, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aircraft Catastrophic Failure Prevention Research Program (ACFPP) collaborated to develop a new material model in LS-DYNA for Aluminum 2024-T351. An initial set of reports were produced as DOT/FAA/AR-13/25 P1-3. This supplemental report describes additional experiments designed and conducted to answer questions that arose during the *MAT_224 card development process. The additional tests were organized into three groups: 1) Dynamic tension tests to study the conversion of plastic work into heat at high strain rates\, 2) tests conducted to determine the fracture strain of 2024-T351 aluminum under a specific state of compression and shear\, and 3) tests conducted to determine the material fracture strain under a certain three-dimensional stress state (inplane biaxial tension and through thickness compression). To study conversion of plastic work to heat\, tension tests on miniature dog-bone coupons were conducted at strain rates ranging from 1E-4 s-1 to 6000 s-1. During the tests\, full-field strain and temperature were measured on opposite sides of the sample using high speed Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and a Telops high speed thermal infrared (IR) camera\, respectively. Both strain and temperature data were superposed on a common coordinate system using MATLAB-based image processing techniques; average Taylor-Quinney (Beta) parameters were then determined. To further characterize the fracture strain dependence on stress state\, an additional stress state was measured via a combined compression and shear (torsion) test using an axial-torsional hydraulic load frame. The new stress state had the highest ratio of compressive to torsional stress tested to date. To study the effect of the in-plane biaxial tension plus through thickness compression on the fracture strain of Aluminum 2024-T35\, a new punch test with a backing plate was designed and conducted. These new tests were based on ASTM E643-15 Standard Test Method for Ball Punch Deformation of Metallic Sheet Material. The standard tests were modified such that the ratio of the die diameter to the punch diameter was dramatically increased and in two cases\, a ductile copper backing plate was added behind the aluminum test specimen\, providing out-of-plane compression. Three types of tests were conducted: 1) unbacked\, 2) backed test with thin copper plate and 3) backed test with thick copper plate.

An initial set of reports were produced as DOT/FAA/AR-13/25 P1-3. This supplemental report describes additional experiments designed and conducted to answer questions that arose during the *MAT_224 card development process. The additional tests were organized into three groups: 1) Dynamic tension tests to study the conversion of plastic work into heat at high strain rates\, 2) tests conducted to determine the fracture strain of 2024-T351 aluminum under a specific state of compression and shear\, and 3) tests conducted to determine the material fracture strain under a certain three-dimensional stress state (inplane biaxial tension and through thickness compression). To study conversion of plastic work to heat\, tension tests on miniature dog-bone coupons were conducted at strain rates ranging from 1E-4 s-1 to 6000 s-1. During the tests\, full-field strain and temperature were measured on opposite sides of the sample using high speed Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and a Telops high speed thermal infrared (IR) camera\, respectively. Both strain and temperature data were superposed on a common coordinate system using MATLAB-based image processing techniques; average Taylor-Quinney (Beta) parameters were then determined. To further characterize the fracture strain dependence on stress state\, an additional stress state was measured via a combined compression and shear (torsion) test using an axial-torsional hydraulic load frame. The new stress state had the highest ratio of compressive to torsional stress tested to date. To study the effect of the in-plane biaxial tension plus through thickness compression on the fracture strain of Aluminum 2024-T35\, a new punch test with a backing plate was designed and conducted. These new tests were based on ASTM E643-15 Standard Test Method for Ball Punch Deformation of Metallic Sheet Material. The standard tests were modified such that the ratio of the die diameter to the punch diameter was dramatically increased and in two cases\, a ductile copper backing plate was added behind the aluminum test specimen\, providing out-of-plane compression. Three types of tests were conducted: 1) unbacked\, 2) backed test with thin copper plate and 3) backed test with thick copper plate. These tests were designed to ensure that the stress triaxiality ranged from -2/3 to 0.113 while maintaining a near constant Lode parameter of -1. Tests conducted for backed experiments included both monotonic tests to failure and sequential loading-unloading tests to analyze strain evolution and failure morphology. Fracture strains for the backed experiments were determined to be substantially higher than those from unbacked (biaxial tension only) tests.,1405",2022-08-01,PDF,,,United States,,2022-08-30T19:49:25.540Z,,Tech Report,Final report,United States.

dot:60942,,,"In a collaborative effort\, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and The Boeing Company are assessing bonded repair technologies of composite panels representative of transport airplane wing structures through test and analysis using the FAA’s Aircraft Beam Structural Test (ABST) fixture. Emphasis has been placed on investigating methods and tools used to conduct analysis and predict structural performance of bonded repairs and those used to monitor and evaluate repair quality over the life of the part. This project is carried out in a phased approach where phase 1 was fixture development and verification. Phase 2 was the initial baseline testing that verified the analysis models and provided an initial reference point for inspection and monitoring systems used to detect and track damage formation. This report discusses the recent third-phase efforts to support bonded repair size limit (BRSL) studies and methods used to predict the limit-load residual strength for a failed scarfed repair in solid composite laminates with full-depth and partial-depth scarf configurations. Scarfs were inserted in carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) panels having an 18-ply quasi-isotropic layup. The panels were attached as top-side components (e.g.\, skins) of a cantilevered\, 24-inch-wide by 40-inch-long wingbox structure. These panels were subjected to constant-moment loads tested either quasi-statically loaded to failure or subjected to fatigue before loading them to failure. The applied fatigue loading conditions simulated highest operational strain levels for transport-category wing panels for 165\,000 cycles\, which is approximately equal to three design service goals (DSGs). The test and analysis results revealed a significant benefit of partial-depth scarfs over full-depth scarfs. In addition\, there was no debit in strength due to fatigue in both type of panels tested. For both full-depth and partial-depth scarf configurations\, the methods under development for BRSL residual strength predictions correlated well with test results.

dot:63525,,693KA9-20-P-00033,"The purpose of this project was to provide a data-driven process to identify sensing technology with good potential for detecting bleed air contamination from engine oil\, hydraulic fluid\, or deicing fluid. Reports from major aircraft cabin air studies were reviewed to identify the range of constituents that can be expected in cabin air\, especially as they pertain to the aforementioned contaminants and their potential markers. One of the projects was the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Vehicle Integrated Propulsion Research (NASA-VIPR) project where controlled amounts of engine oil were injected into the engine compressor of a C-17 transport aircraft and the resulting contaminants in the bleed air measured. Three additional cabin air quality studies conducted on revenue flights were reviewed. These three studies provide data for a combined total of 249 flights on a variety of makes and models of aircraft. These studies provide adequate documentation of typical aircraft cabin air. Information from this review was used to identify potential markers of the bleed air contaminants. Additionally\, collaboration was established with several technical committees from the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)\, American Society of Heating\, Air-Conditioning and Refrigerating Engineers (ASHRAE)\, and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and with project personnel from the prior European Union Aviation Safety Administration (EASA)-funded cabin air study.

Reports from major aircraft cabin air studies were reviewed to identify the range of constituents that can be expected in cabin air\, especially as they pertain to the aforementioned contaminants and their potential markers. One of the projects was the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Vehicle Integrated Propulsion Research (NASA-VIPR) project where controlled amounts of engine oil were injected into the engine compressor of a C-17 transport aircraft and the resulting contaminants in the bleed air measured. Three additional cabin air quality studies conducted on revenue flights were reviewed. These three studies provide data for a combined total of 249 flights on a variety of makes and models of aircraft. These studies provide adequate documentation of typical aircraft cabin air. Information from this review was used to identify potential markers of the bleed air contaminants. Additionally\, collaboration was established with several technical committees from the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)\, American Society of Heating\, Air-Conditioning and Refrigerating Engineers (ASHRAE)\, and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and with project personnel from the prior European Union Aviation Safety Administration (EASA)-funded cabin air study. Key objectives of the project were to identify sensors and sensing technology with potential for detection of one or more of the three aforementioned bleed air contaminants and to develop a plan for test stand engine experiments to evaluate the sensors with controlled amounts of the three contaminants.

This fire load consisted of lithium-ion batteries and a combination of ordinary combustible materials and flammable liquids. VERDAGENT® demonstrated successful performance in the MPS. Component separation was not observed\, and the agent was found to disperse uniformly in the cargo compartment. The agent also performed effectively against the additional challenge fire test. The results summarize that VERDAGENT® met the requirements of the MPS for aircraft cargo compartment Halon replacement fire suppression systems.",2022-09-01,PDF,,,United States,,2022-11-07T17:02:45.408Z,,Tech Report,,United States.

dot:62423,,FAA Grant 12-G-001,"Simulating uncontained engine fragment impact to composite aircraft structures requires material models\, which can accurately account for the deformation\, damage\, and failure experienced during these highly dynamic events. The FAA Aircraft Catastrophic Failure Prevention Program sponsored the development of a new material model known as MAT_213 to model composite impact\, which has been implemented into the commercial finite element software LS-DYNA. This report provides results for stacked-ply T800/F3900 carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite validation tests conducted at room temperature with uniaxial tension and compression loads applied at quasi-static rates by Arizona State University. Stress concentration validation tests were also conducted on stacked-ply specimens with a centered hole. Digital Image Correlation was used to obtain the experimental surface strain contours. MAT_213 was used to conduct simulations comparing stress-strain relationships\, strain profiles\, and displacement results to the experiments. The MAT_213 material inputs were obtained from specimen tests performed previously. Additionally\, as part of this study\, delamination tests were conducted using end notch flexure and double cantilevered beam specimens to characterize mode I and mode II fracture properties of the T800/F3900 composite. These experimental results were used to build models with MAT_138 cohesive zone elements for the interlaminar polymer matrix between the composite ply layers modeled with MAT_213. The test results were necessary to calibrate numerical inputs to the traction separation laws governing the delamination behavior. Scanning electron microscope analysis was also utilized to examine specimens in the untested\, damaged\, and failed states. The results provided insight to the microstructural damage induced from manufacturing\, specimen preparation processing\, and loading of the T800/F3900 composite.",Active,T800-F3900 Composite Stacked Ply Laminate Testing and Modeling Using MAT_213,English,"Composite structures,Orthotropic,Plasticity,Testing,Investigation of structure,Tolerances (Engineering),Mechanical failure,Finite element method,Impact tests,MAT 213,T800/F3900,orthotropic plasticity,material characterization testing,cohesive zone modeling,LS-DYNA,explicit finite element analysis",2022-07-26T16:24:31.754Z,FAA Technical Library,English,T800-F3900 Composite Stacked Ply Laminate Testing and Modeling Using MAT_213,DOT/FAA/TC-21/56,,Arizona State University.

The FAA Aircraft Catastrophic Failure Prevention Program sponsored the development of a new material model known as MAT_213 to model composite impact\, which has been implemented into the commercial finite element software LS-DYNA. This report provides results for stacked-ply T800/F3900 carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite validation tests conducted at room temperature with uniaxial tension and compression loads applied at quasi-static rates by Arizona State University. Stress concentration validation tests were also conducted on stacked-ply specimens with a centered hole. Digital Image Correlation was used to obtain the experimental surface strain contours. MAT_213 was used to conduct simulations comparing stress-strain relationships\, strain profiles\, and displacement results to the experiments. The MAT_213 material inputs were obtained from specimen tests performed previously. Additionally\, as part of this study\, delamination tests were conducted using end notch flexure and double cantilevered beam specimens to characterize mode I and mode II fracture properties of the T800/F3900 composite. These experimental results were used to build models with MAT_138 cohesive zone elements for the interlaminar polymer matrix between the composite ply layers modeled with MAT_213. The test results were necessary to calibrate numerical inputs to the traction separation laws governing the delamination behavior. Scanning electron microscope analysis was also utilized to examine specimens in the untested\, damaged\, and failed states. The results provided insight to the microstructural damage induced from manufacturing\, specimen preparation processing\, and loading of the T800/F3900 composite.,1367",2022-05-01,PDF,,,United States,,2022-06-13T20:57:12.112Z,,Tech Report,Final Report,United States.

dot:63085,,,"Objective: We investigated pilot weather assessments and pilot ability to assess the out-the-window visibility. Specifically\, we assessed the impact of a time-based active reminder on pilot decision-making. The active reminder indicated the amount of time in which a pilot might encroach within 20 miles of severe weather along their route. Background: In a previous study\, the WTIC group evaluated a distance-based active reminder to indicate pilot proximity to severe weather. Method: Fifty private pilots participated in the study. The pilots were randomly allocated to either the 10 nm or 20 nm active reminder condition to fly in a scenario with degrading visibility conditions. Results: We found no important differences between the AR10 and AR20 groups with regards to aircraft altitude\, AWOS usage\, distance-to-weather\, flight decision-making\, and the ability of pilots to provide forward visibility estimates. This result implies that the difference in lead-time (i.e.\, 10 versus 20 miles) did not affect the flying behavior of pilots. Both pilot groups flew equally close to hazardous weather cells (i.e.\, ≥ 30 dBZ precipitation cells) with a mean distance-to-weather of 9.93 to 17.2 miles (95% HDIs). Even more striking\, comparing the present distance-to-weather results with the distance-to-weather data from the Ahlstrom et al.

Hughes Technical Center,United States,Aircraft,Aviation safety,Behavior,Driver support systems,General aviation,Hazard evaluation,Weather routing,Weather,Real time information,DOT/FAA/TC-20/41,Objective: We investigated pilot weather assessments and pilot ability to assess the out-the-window visibility. Specifically\, we assessed the impact of a time-based active reminder on pilot decision-making. The active reminder indicated the amount of time in which a pilot might encroach within 20 miles of severe weather along their route. Background: In a previous study\, the WTIC group evaluated a distance-based active reminder to indicate pilot proximity to severe weather. Method: Fifty private pilots participated in the study. The pilots were randomly allocated to either the 10 nm or 20 nm active reminder condition to fly in a scenario with degrading visibility conditions. Results: We found no important differences between the AR10 and AR20 groups with regards to aircraft altitude\, AWOS usage\, distance-to-weather\, flight decision-making\, and the ability of pilots to provide forward visibility estimates. This result implies that the difference in lead-time (i.e.\, 10 versus 20 miles) did not affect the flying behavior of pilots. Both pilot groups flew equally close to hazardous weather cells (i.e.\, ≥ 30 dBZ precipitation cells) with a mean distance-to-weather of 9.93 to 17.2 miles (95% HDIs). Even more striking\, comparing the present distance-to-weather results with the distance-to-weather data from the Ahlstrom et al. (2019a) study showed that a time-based AR yield a much larger intra-group dispersion (e.g.\, SD) of the distance-to-weather data\, expressed as a greater variability among pilots with regards to how closely they flew to hazardous weather cells.,1405",2020-07-01,PDF,,,United States,,2022-08-01T17:50:59.366Z,,Tech Report,,United States.

dot:57647,,,"This work surveyed aircraft accidents/incidents in which a bond failure was a contributing factor. This survey was used to identify potential shortfalls in the certification of bonded structures. We reviewed\, summarized\, and compiled investigation reports\, safety recommendations\, and airworthiness directives associated with bond failure-related events. These documents originated mainly from countries with large civil aviation fleets that maintain online\, publicly available databases. This survey was limited to typecertified\, civil aeronautical products\, irrespective of the manufacturer\, model\, size\, or age. A total of 73 bond-related events involving aircraft registered in 13 countries on five continents were found. We grouped these events according to the aeronautical product—transport airplanes\, general aviation airplanes\, rotorcraft\, propellers\, and engines—containing the failed bonded joint. Each of these groups is type-certified under specific airworthiness requirements. For each event\, we classified the bond failure’s root causes into the following categories: design\, production\, operation\, and maintenance. Analysis of the compiled data revealed that maintenance or production issues often contributed to the reviewed bond-related events. This analysis also emphasized the need for process control/validation and durability substantiation to ensure the long-term safe operation of bonded structures. The data supports a conclusion that no additional layer of protection—e.g.\, load path redundancy\, damage growth arrest features\, environmental protection measures\, damage tolerance-based maintenance actions\, or advanced nondestructive inspections—can alone guarantee the expected joint structural performance in case of substandard bonding without adequate material and process control.

dot:60053,,,"This research presents a set of investigation results of a prototype (PAR46 size) landing light that incorporated ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UVLEDs) in ‘real-world’ flight conditions for the benefit of Bird Strike Mitigation for Rotorcraft. The research measured the effectiveness of using a prototype Bird UVLEDs integrated into a PAR46 landing light to trigger bird avoidance behavioral responses\, which would increase flight path separation to reduce the incidence of bird strikes. The first set of field trials involved a one-quarter scale remote controlled (RC) plane. The second set of field trials involved an AirTractor 802 aircraft performing flight operations\, with nominal flight speeds of 150 kt and < 100’ above ground level (AGL)\, in the performance of agricultural chemical delivery. Concrete examples are illustrated throughout the report to make the concepts clear. Field data of measured bird responses to the deterrence device ON/OFF condition of the PAR46 with UVLED landing light was statistically modeled for correlation with environmental conditions. The environmental flight conditions were recalculated to determine the SNR (signal to noise ratio) of the bird’s visual system to the approaching plane\, corresponding to the time of change in bird behavior identified as flight direction\, altitude\, or speed as recorded by an on-board video camera.

dot:64752,,,"A Dissertation Presented in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. An orthotropic elasto-plastic damage material model (OEPDMM) suitable for impact simulations has been developed through a joint research project funded by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Development of the model includes derivation of the theoretical details\, implementation of the theory into LS-DYNA®\, a commercially available nonlinear transient dynamic finite element code\, as material model MAT 213\, and verification and validation of the model. The material model is comprised of three major components: deformation\, damage\, and failure. The deformation sub-model is used to capture both linear and nonlinear deformations through a classical plasticity formulation. The damage sub-model is used to account for the reduction of elastic stiffness of the material as the degree of plastic strain is increased. Finally\, the failure sub-model is used to predict the onset of loss of load carrying capacity in the material. OEPDMM is driven completely by tabulated experimental data obtained through physically meaningful material characterization tests\, through high fidelity virtual tests\, or both. The tabulated data includes stress-strain curves at different temperatures and strain rates to drive the deformation sub-model\, damage parameter-total strain curves to drive the damage sub-model\, and the failure sub-model can be driven by the data required for different failure theories implemented in the computer code.

dot:58295,,,"Joint quality affects stresses and deflections\, which result from gear and environmental loading\, and\, hence\, short- and long-term performance of rigid pavements. More specifically\, multiple researchers have shown that looseness of dowel bars greatly affects responses of Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement and its performance due to the reduction in load-transfer efficiency. Aware of the relevance of joint efficiency\, researchers have used multiple approaches to include it in analyses: closed-form solutions\, finite element (FE) analysis\, and response from pavement instrumentation. This study combines the three approaches to consider the effect of joint continuity on temperature responses of airfield rigid pavement. Curling and blowup analysis was performed on airfield rigid pavement\, considering generalized boundary conditions. The analysis combined closed-form solutions\, FE methods\, and pavement instrumentation. Closed-form solutions were derived for the curling responses and stability analysis (i.e.\, pavement blowup) for a slab-on-grade pavement with partially restrained edges. The closed-form solutions were verified using the FE method. Furthermore\, an FE model validated with experimental measurements was used to study the influence of joint condition on the responses to temperature of a multilayer airfield rigid pavement. In general\, curling responses and blowup load are significantly affected by the continuity along a slab’s edges. Joint condition is more relevant for short slabs\, and that aspect ratio is relevant when there is good continuity among slabs. Although conventional analysis does not consider a slab’s rotational continuity along the joints\, this variable is more relevant than continuity of vertical displacement.

dot:57637,,,"This research identifies ways to identify and mitigate obsolescence risks in avionics and to provide related aviation safety input to the Federal Aviation Administration for the development of regulations\, policy\, guidance\, and training. Obsolescence and obsolescence management of avionics products are a technically challenging and costly financial problem with many adverse business impacts for both the avionics suppliers and their customers. Though obsolescence is not unique to the aerospace industry\, it presents special problems because of the typically long life cycle of aircraft and a requirement to comply with airworthiness regulations that make continuous change complex and costly. Obsolescence is the inevitable consequence of the dependence of aerospace on a supply base whose major markets are outside of aerospace and whose technology life cycles are much shorter than those of other markets. Aerospace has a continual demand for technological progress in aircraft system capabilities and safety improvements\, but on a much longer timescale than the technology turnover timescale of the supply base. Obsolescence is an inevitable occurrence; therefore\, the goal of obsolescence and lifecycle management is to minimize the recurring cost impacts and the disruption of supply to customers while maintaining continued airworthiness and regulatory compliance. This report describes the current state of obsolescence management in the aerospace industry; the processes\, standards\, and tools now being used; and the underlying causes. The report addresses the identification\, mitigation\, and avoidance of issues related to obsolescence in systems\, software\, and airborne electronic hardware development; the related design assurance and certification considerations; and optimal methods for life-cycle maintenance and technical refreshment. The report identifies known and emerging obstacles\, problems\, issues\, and gaps in existing standards and guidance; proposes standards and assurance techniques that may minimize the impact of obsolescence; and suggests how manufacturers can proactively plan and manage the life cycle of their products. The report describes the extant research on numerical methods for obsolescence risk assessment and related economic modeling\, and provides recommendations for further public guidance and standards that would assist industry and users in adapting to a dynamic environment. The report suggests some industry and regulatory practices that could promote best practices; reduce costs and inconvenience; and improve the product life-cycle planning process. Finally\, the report suggests some relevant research topics that are not well addressed presently and should be considered for future work. The report suggests that the obsolescence problem cannot be solved only by engineering methods\, but also requires proactive measures and risk-awareness planning by both customers and suppliers. Obsolescence is a complex mix of engineering\, economic\, and business issues with many associated uncertainties. These uncertainties arise from the supply base and the customer base\, which require marketing\, engineering\, and economic planning and analysis using numerical risk-assessment methods that measure uncertainty.",Active,Obsolescence and Life Cycle Management for Avionics,English,"Aviation safety,Aircraft,Aerospace engineering,Aerospace industry,Life cycle analysis",2022-02-01T15:35:43.165Z,FAA Technical Library,English,Obsolescence and Life Cycle Management for Avionics,DOT/FAA/TC-15/33,,United States.

Recently\, a request was submitted to ship medical devices containing small quantities of gaseous nitrous oxide (N2O). As part of the certification process\, the manufacturer of this device completed the PHMSA-required thermal resistance and flame penetration tests; however\, the packaging was unable to pass the thermal resistance portion of the required tests and small quantities of N2O were able to escape.

Although N2O is not flammable\, it is an oxidizing agent that could exacerbate an otherwise controlled cargo compartment fire\, and ultimately overwhelm the integrity of the suppression and containment capabilities of the system. Tests were conducted within an aircraft lower deck (LD-3) sized steel test chamber using a fire load of eighteen cardboard boxes filled with shredded paper. During each test\, the shredded paper was ignited and the ensuing fire was allowed to develop.

Results indicated that released quantities of N2O less than or equal to 11.6 oz did not produce a significant reaction within the fire in the test chamber.

dot:58292,,,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) defines a runway incursion (RI) as “any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an aircraft\, vehicle\, or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and takeoff of aircraft.” These occurrences\, including wrong runway landings and takeoffs\, remain a top airport safety concern for the FAA. Research shows that airport geometry can contribute to RIs. The FAA provides airports with guidance on recommended taxiway layouts in both Advisory Circular 150/5300-13 and Engineering Brief Number 75. Airport layouts not conforming to these recommendations may lead to pilot confusion and ultimately\, RIs. The FAA launched the Runway Incursion Mitigation (RIM) program in fiscal year (FY) 2015 in an effort to mitigate the nonstandard geometry factors present at airport locations that experienced a high number of RIs. The FAA maintains a RIM program database updated on an annual basis\, including only towered airports. During each annual update\, all RIs (pilot deviation (PD) and vehicle/pedestrian deviation (V/PD)) and surface incidents from the previous calendar year (CY)\, including wrong surface landings and takeoffs\, are georeferenced in the geographic information system database. An annual review of the layout of each airport determines if locations with previously identified nonstandard geometry characteristics have changed and/or been mitigated. New locations with nonstandard geometry characteristics are also identified. If a location has three or more RIs that occur in a CY\, or cumulative incursion counts that average one or more RIs per year of data analyzed\, it is considered for inclusion in the RIM inventory. Since the 2019 database update\, cumulative incursion analyses are limited to the previous 10 calendar years of available RI data (e.g.\, 2010-2019). This report captures the RIM program summary through FY2020\, annual updates\, and current inventory. Since initiation of the RIM program in FY2015\, a total of 7\,826 RIs (PD and V/PD) and 185 nonstandard geometry locations were added to the database\, bringing the total to 12\,925 RIs and 6\,286 nonstandard geometry locations. At the end of FY2020\, there were 134 locations in the RIM inventory at 79 airports and 63 locations mitigated since the program’s inception. Airports utilized a variety of mitigation strategies to eliminate the problematic geometry characteristics or reduce their effect at these locations. Mitigation strategies include modifications to airport geometry\, changes to lighting\, markings\, or signage\, or changes to procedures or operations.",Active,Runway Incursion Mitigation Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Summary Report,English,"Airports,Aviation safety,Databases,Geographic information systems,Geometry,Runway incursions,Taxiways,Airport planning,Plane geometry,Runway incursion mitigation,Airport design,Problematic geometry",2021-12-13T19:32:03.307Z,FAA Technical Library,English,Runway Incursion Mitigation Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Summary Report,DOT/FAA/TC-21/10,,"United States.

dot:58294,,,"The Federal Aviation Administration instrumented four concrete slabs of a taxiway at the John F. Kennedy International Airport to collect pavement responses under aircraft and environmental loading. The study started with developing preprocessing scripts to organize\, structure\, and clean the collected data. As a result of the preprocessing step\, the data became easier and more intuitive for pavement engineers and researchers to transform and process. After the data were cleaned and organized\, they were used to develop two prediction models. The first prediction model employs a Bayesian calibration framework to estimate the unknown material parameters of the concrete pavement.

Kennedy International Airport to collect pavement responses under aircraft and environmental loading. The study started with developing preprocessing scripts to organize\, structure\, and clean the collected data. As a result of the preprocessing step\, the data became easier and more intuitive for pavement engineers and researchers to transform and process. After the data were cleaned and organized\, they were used to develop two prediction models. The first prediction model employs a Bayesian calibration framework to estimate the unknown material parameters of the concrete pavement. Additionally\, the posterior distributions resulting from the calibration process served as a sensitivity analysis by reporting the significance of each parameter for temperature distribution. The second prediction model utilized a machine-learning (ML) algorithm to predict pavement responses under aircraft and environmental loadings. The results demonstrated that ML can predict the responses with high accuracy at a low computational cost.

dot:57814,,,"One of the challenges in building a predictive numerical model for composites is the ability to model accurately the behavior of the structure\, especially under impact loading. This report describes a newly developed orthotropic material model that has three distinct sub-models for deformation\, damage\, and failure of general composites. This model has been implemented in the commercial finite element program—LS-DYNA—as *MAT_213 (*MAT_COMPOSITE_TABULATED_PLASTICITY _DAMAGE). Tabulated data can be generated for this model using laboratory tests or via virtual testing. The yield function is a modified form of the Tsai-Wu failure model. A non-associated plastic flow is used. Rate and temperature dependence are supported along with tension-compression asymmetric behavior. The damage sub-model enables uncoupled and coupled parameters to be defined. Strain equivalence between the true and the effective stress space permits decoupling of the plasticity and damage calculations. The failure modeling is currently being enhanced\, however\, the initial version in this report describes some of the most commonly used failure criteria\, including principal strain\, Tsai-Wu\, and a generalized tabulated laminate failure criterion.

dot:58010,,,"A finite element model of the Fokker F28 Fellowship aircraft\, which was previously validated for structural impacts\, was used to perform LS-DYNA simulations to mimic the 2009 US Airways Flight 1549 crash into the Hudson River. The LS-DYNA model of the F28 was originally developed from an existing NASTRAN loads model and was validated through test-analysis comparisons with data from a full-scale crash test of the F28 onto soil. The F28 aircraft was simulated for the Flight 1549 impact conditions\, not to precisely predict the response of the Airbus A320 aircraft used for that flight\, but to evaluate tools for simulating and analyzing water impact for a realistic aircraft ditching event. Impact conditions were: Vx (longitudinal velocity) = 211 ft/s (2\,532 in/s) and Vz (vertical velocity) = 12.5 ft/s (150 in/s). The impact attitude was: Roll = 0.0°\, Pitch (nose up) = 9.5°\, and Yaw = 0.0°. This Fluid-Structure Interaction simulation was executed using the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) capability in LS-DYNA. Results are presented in several categories including seat base and airframe accelerations; model kinematic responses\, impact sequences\, and damage evaluation; and occupant responses and injury risk assessment. Findings show that predicted seat base and airframe accelerations in both the vertical and longitudinal directions are relatively low\, 15-g or less\, resulting in a fairly benign impact event. Likewise\, simulations of the occupant breakout models predicted injury risk values well below the defined safety limits for dynamic loading certification.

dot:65489,,DTFACT-17-C-00001,"Loss of control at low altitude in the traffic pattern is one of the main causes of fatal accidents in general aviation. Many loss-of-control accidents can be attributed to the pilot losing awareness of the energy state of the aircraft. An intuitive and accessible display for energy state and specific excess power can potentially remedy these types of accidents. As general aviation aircraft are not equipped to measure a significant number of dynamic parameters\, such a predictive energy display must be based on an algorithm running on a reduced set of parameters readily available from the current generation of light aircraft avionics.

Many loss-of-control accidents can be attributed to the pilot losing awareness of the energy state of the aircraft. An intuitive and accessible display for energy state and specific excess power can potentially remedy these types of accidents. As general aviation aircraft are not equipped to measure a significant number of dynamic parameters\, such a predictive energy display must be based on an algorithm running on a reduced set of parameters readily available from the current generation of light aircraft avionics.

dot:66768,,,"Wire strikes have been one of the most common sources of helicopter accidents in the past seven years. The sizes of poles and wires make it difficult for rotorcraft pilots to see them in-flight. This motivates the need to provide pilots with various tools and information to prevent accidents related to wire strikes. In this report\, we present different ways to enhance the safety of helicopters when operating at altitudes where wire strikes are possible. The first way enables the prediction of the wire grid from street view and satellite imagery using deep learning techniques. The outcome is a dataset of predicted wire locations that may be displayed in 2D or 3D on moving maps of electronic flight bags or in the cockpit avionics. The second way of preventing rotorcraft wire strikes is the development of a 360-degree radar system able to detect wires in-flight at a minimum distance of 50’ from any part of the rotorcraft. The third way is to fuse the information from the predicted wire database with the measured data from the sensor in order to improve the predicted wire locations in real time.

Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory,true,"2023-02-01; \,","Wire strikes have been one of the most common sources of helicopter accidents in the past seven years. The sizes of poles and wires make it difficult for rotorcraft pilots to see them in-flight. This motivates the need to provide pilots with various tools and information to prevent accidents related to wire strikes. In this report\, we present different ways to enhance the safety of helicopters when operating at altitudes where wire strikes are possible. The first way enables the prediction of the wire grid from street view and satellite imagery using deep learning techniques. The outcome is a dataset of predicted wire locations that may be displayed in 2D or 3D on moving maps of electronic flight bags or in the cockpit avionics. The second way of preventing rotorcraft wire strikes is the development of a 360-degree radar system able to detect wires in-flight at a minimum distance of 50’ from any part of the rotorcraft. The third way is to fuse the information from the predicted wire database with the measured data from the sensor in order to improve the predicted wire locations in real time. A fourth way is to develop a new wire cutter system able to cut various sizes of cables when installed on lightweight helicopters. To do so\, we develop a physics-based modeling and simulation environment where various types of helicopters\, wires\, and cutter systems may be implemented and assessed.

Recently\, the use of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) has attracted attention as an option for performing cost-effective and efficient pavement inspections.

dot:71734,,,"Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a Staffed NextGen Tower (SNT) environment on air traffic control (ATC) operations. The primary objective was to determine whether cameras are beneficial for SNT operations. Background: The SNT concept shifts from relying primarily on the out-the-window view to a model that relies more on using surveillance and cameras. There are different ways to implement the SNT concept. Two alternatives are Supplemental use (in addition to out the window display) and Contingency use (when the out the window view is unavailable). Method: Eight controllers ran traffic in this study with two main conditions\, Supplemental and Contingency\, with four off-nominal events (aircraft crosses unoccupied runway\, aircraft crosses occupied runway\, wheels up on approach\, aborted takeoff aircraft on runway). Results: The controllers were able to perform their jobs effectively in both Supplemental and Contingency conditions using cameras and surveillance displays. Controllers in conditions with the camera consistently detected the ―wheels up on approach‖ off-nominal condition. Controllers in conditions without the camera did not detect the ―wheels up on approach‖ off-nominal condition at all. The other three off-nominal conditions were detected primarily using the Traffic Information Display System (TIDS) and alerts. The controllers rated the camera as essential in both Supplemental and Contingency conditions\, although less for Supplemental than Contingency. Controllers agreed that the SNT concept would be beneficial for the National Airspace System (NAS) and for control tower operations. Conclusion: Results of this study show that controllers can perform their jobs effectively in both Supplemental and Contingency SNT environments and show that cameras provide a benefit to operations. Applications: These findings will directly influence decisions on the SNT concept implementation. Although cameras were found to be beneficial\, we will still need to refine the details of camera coverage\, display configuration\, and control functionality.

These flight test maneuvers\, when executed by at least three test pilot evaluators\, provide assigned levels of handling qualities using the well-established Cooper-Harper Handling Qualities Rating Scale. Later\, a comprehensive flight test guide was created to layout the procedures and test methods needed to generate the required data to evaluate a given design against the quantitative requirements included in the design standard.

dot:74525,,,"In fiscal year (FY) 2012\, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Office of Airports (ARP) initiated a research study to identify and geographically locate areas at airports with nonstandard taxiway geometry. This research was advanced because an earlier study (Legarreta\, 2012) had shown nonstandard taxiway geometries to be associated with a higher prevalence of runway incursions. The FAA defines a runway incursion (RI) as “any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an aircraft\, vehicle\, or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and takeoff of aircraft” (FAA\, 2015). These occurrences include wrong runway landings and takeoffs. This research effort developed a geographic information system (GIS) database of approximately 520 airports with civilian air traffic control towers. For each airport\, the location of nonstandard geometries\, runway incursions\, airfield hotspot areas\, airport diagrams\, and other airport-related information is identified. This research study identified 140 airfield locations with high incidences of RIs using data from October 1\, 2007\, to September 30\, 2013. As a result\, a 15- to 20-year improvement program\, known as the Runway Incursion Mitigation (RIM) program\, launched in FY2015. The goal of the program was to mitigate airfield locations with high incidences of RIs. A subset of the 140 locations identified was then validated for inclusion in the RIM program and prioritized for mitigation. The RIM program is updated annually using the GIS airport database to identify construction-related changes to airfield layout and their impacts on taxiway geometries\, the airfield location of new RIs\, and the status of airfield locations prioritized for mitigation. This report summarizes the status of the RIM program through FY2023. In 2023\, the program georeferenced 1\,330 RIs; added 62 nonstandard geometry locations; prioritized 16 locations for mitigation; and identified 13 locations as mitigated. Since the program’s initiation\, 16\,521 RIs have been georeferenced at airports along with more than 6\,695 nonstandard geometry locations. In addition\, 230 airfield locations were prioritized for mitigation\, and 100 of these locations have been mitigated. For mitigated locations and incursion data through calendar year 2022\, the incursion rate has been reduced by 69 percent.",Active,Runway Incursion Mitigation Fiscal Year 2023 Annual Summary Report,English,"Airport planning,Runway incursions,Crash avoidance systems,Plane geometry,Geometric design,Taxiways,Problematic geometry",2025-01-21T16:35:13.576Z,FAA Technical Library,English,Runway Incursion Mitigation Fiscal Year 2023 Annual Summary Report,DOT/FAA/TC-24/12,"Airport planning,Runway incursions,Crash avoidance systems,Plane geometry,Geometric design,Taxiways,Problematic geometry","United States.

Airport Engineering Division,AECOM",FAA Technical Library,"In fiscal year (FY) 2012\, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Office of Airports (ARP) initiated a research study to identify and geographically locate areas at airports with nonstandard taxiway geometry. This research was advanced because an earlier study (Legarreta\, 2012) had shown nonstandard taxiway geometries to be associated with a higher prevalence of runway incursions. The FAA defines a runway incursion (RI) as “any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an aircraft\, vehicle\, or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and takeoff of aircraft” (FAA\, 2015). These occurrences include wrong runway landings and takeoffs. This research effort developed a geographic information system (GIS) database of approximately 520 airports with civilian air traffic control towers. For each airport\, the location of nonstandard geometries\, runway incursions\, airfield hotspot areas\, airport diagrams\, and other airport-related information is identified. This research study identified 140 airfield locations with high incidences of RIs using data from October 1\, 2007\, to September 30\, 2013. As a result\, a 15- to 20-year improvement program\, known as the Runway Incursion Mitigation (RIM) program\, launched in FY2015. The goal of the program was to mitigate airfield locations with high incidences of RIs. A subset of the 140 locations identified was then validated for inclusion in the RIM program and prioritized for mitigation. The RIM program is updated annually using the GIS airport database to identify construction-related changes to airfield layout and their impacts on taxiway geometries\, the airfield location of new RIs\, and the status of airfield locations prioritized for mitigation. This report summarizes the status of the RIM program through FY2023. In 2023\, the program georeferenced 1\,330 RIs; added 62 nonstandard geometry locations; prioritized 16 locations for mitigation; and identified 13 locations as mitigated. Since the program’s initiation\, 16\,521 RIs have been georeferenced at airports along with more than 6\,695 nonstandard geometry locations. In addition\, 230 airfield locations were prioritized for mitigation\, and 100 of these locations have been mitigated. For mitigated locations and incursion data through calendar year 2022\, the incursion rate has been reduced by 69 percent.",,,,,,urn:sha256:028fea6bd629de9f3278202915d3921954e95bacc6139f291fd7b8d3dd59333a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dot:71732,,,"Objective: This paper uses a review of previous studies to provide a recommendation for the optimal scale size of the Air Traffic Workload Input Technique (ATWIT). Background: The ATWIT is a measure of workload that was originally a 10-point scale\, but subsequent research includes a 7-point variation of this scale. Scale size is known to impact assessment reliability\, and more reliable scales produce stronger effect sizes and reduce costs that are associated with experimentation. Therefore\, it is important to know whether the 7-point or 10-point version of the scale is more reliable. Method: The authors conducted a preliminary meta-analysis of 15 studies. The analysis examined correlations between ratings using the ATWIT and aircraft count (an objective measure of difficulty) to compare effect sizes across studies with a 7-point scale and a 10-point scale. Results: Findings indicated that the strength of the correlation between ATWIT ratings and aircraft count was greater for the 10-point version of the ATWIT than for the 7-point version. Conclusion: The 10-point scale appears to be more appropriate for the ATWIT than the 7-point scale.

The Federal Aviation Administration Human Factors Branch conducted a study to examine potential modifications to the system.

The first simulation investigated the automation requirements needed to assist controllers in working en route sectors capable of accommodating 3-nmi (5.56 km) and 5-nmi (9.26 km) separation standards. Method: Eighteen (12 retired\, 6 current) en route air traffic controllers participated in the study.

dot:71712,,,"The purpose of this study was to collect data on current workplace ergonomic conditions at Federal Aviation Administration Operations Control Centers. Ergonomic issues and associated work-related musculoskeletal disorders can arise due to a combination of factors including environmental conditions\, workstation design\, frequency and duration of tasks\, and psychosocial considerations. In order to create a comprehensive picture of Operational Control Center ergonomics\, researchers collected a range of data. Researchers collected data on the workplace environment\, including temperature\, lighting\, and noise. They collected workstation data\, measuring the dimensions and features of the desks and chairs and comparing them to standards. Researchers observed and recorded the frequency and duration of user activities during periods of typical work. Finally\, they collected data through a questionnaire\, which allowed the participants to provide feedback and ratings on their current level of discomfort and on various aspects of their work environment. The research team identified instances where measurements of the current workplace did not meet recommended standards\, including temperature\, lighting\, and workstation adjustability.

dot:71682,,,"The NAS is a highly structured environment. Structure provides benefits including predictability for the decision-maker\, the air traffic controller. When something is unusual\, controllers can identify the event as out of the ordinary given their inherent and trained capacity for pattern recognition. The expertise in pattern recognition does not develop quickly. In the current system\, it takes En Route controllers an average of about three years to certify as Certified Professional Controllers (CPCs\, formerly Full Performance Level). In general\, CPCs must learn and checkout on at least six different sectors to certify. There are situations\, however\, when the usual structure is reduced and the typical patterns do not work. This can happen with weather events and systems outages as examples. Dynamic resectorization offers a tool in these situations to increase the options and promote flexibility. In our current system\, traffic managers can resectorize in a very systematic structured way to balance the load and increase the level of structure for controllers. The system of the future may include several types of resectorization supported by automation tools. Limited dynamic resectorization is similar to what is done now but may see more widespread use.

Department of Transportation. Federal Aviation Administration. William J. Hughes Technical Center,true,"2005-12-01; \,","The NAS is a highly structured environment. Structure provides benefits including predictability for the decision-maker\, the air traffic controller. When something is unusual\, controllers can identify the event as out of the ordinary given their inherent and trained capacity for pattern recognition. The expertise in pattern recognition does not develop quickly. In the current system\, it takes En Route controllers an average of about three years to certify as Certified Professional Controllers (CPCs\, formerly Full Performance Level). In general\, CPCs must learn and checkout on at least six different sectors to certify. There are situations\, however\, when the usual structure is reduced and the typical patterns do not work. This can happen with weather events and systems outages as examples. Dynamic resectorization offers a tool in these situations to increase the options and promote flexibility. In our current system\, traffic managers can resectorize in a very systematic structured way to balance the load and increase the level of structure for controllers. The system of the future may include several types of resectorization supported by automation tools. Limited dynamic resectorization is similar to what is done now but may see more widespread use.

dot:71725,,,"Objective: The purpose of this study is to establish whether a valid performance criterion exists to determine the acceptability of the En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) Conflict Probe’s conflict-detection accuracy and to evaluate observed accuracy against this criterion. Background: The Conflict Probe can exhibit very high or very low accuracy depending on the analysis technique. It is necessary to establish both an empirically backed criterion for accuracy and the appropriate accuracy analyses and metrics. Method: A meta-analysis was conducted on Human Factors automation reliability literature; an additional analysis was done on the results of probe reliability studies by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Concept Analysis branch to derive various accuracy metrics. The results were compared to determine the acceptability of the conflict probe accuracy. Results: The meta-analysis produced an estimated criterion of 65% correct responses for automation to improve performance\, but this estimate is subject to a broad confidence interval due to variability in the source data from the literature. The probe performance exceeded the 65% value when giving credit for all correct rejections\, but it fell short when not giving credit for correct rejections. Another metric\, Positive Predictive Value (PPV\, the percent of alerts that are valid)\, is operationally meaningful and its values demonstrated large accuracy improvements over baseline with the FAA Concept Analysis’ parametric adjustments\, but a PPV cutoff criterion could not be established from the meta-analysis. Conclusion: The present results provide insight on several fronts\, but operational input is essential to determine (1) a more justifiable air traffic control-specific accuracy criterion and (2) which aircraft encounters are appropriate to include in a test set for accuracy assessment.

The EFDIs will be used to automate some flight data management tasks\, to provide new tools designed to reduce controller workload and improve safety\, and to improve controller efficiency by integrating information.

Background: Tower controllers in proposed SNT environments will use certified surveillance and camera views instead of the out-the-window view while providing Air Traffic Control services. As the use of cameras for this purpose is a new concept\, there are many different ways this concept could be implemented. This study examined some of the alternatives for implementing the SNT concept in a realistic environment. Method: In this study\, four NextGen Air Traffic Control Management Cadre members controlled traffic and evaluated camera use during nine 15-minute\, low-level traffic scenarios that included off-nominal events. At the end of each scenario and at the end of the study\, the participants completed a questionnaire\, suggested improvements\, and provided comments on adequacy\, necessity\, and usability of the cameras and displays. Results: The participants suggested making several changes to the camera system prior to future studies.

dot:71731,,,"Objective: The overarching goal of this study is to perform a human factors assessment of the effects of variations in cockpit weather symbology on General Aviation (GA) pilot symbol perception. Background: To support the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) program\, ongoing efforts focus on the implementation and use of weather technologies and weather presentations. Method: Sixty instrument-rated GA pilots volunteered to participate in the study. We manipulated the independent variable Weather Presentations by presenting weather information under three different symbology modes. In Experiment 1\, we assess pilot perception of METAR symbols during flight and assess how this affects flight behavior\, cognitive engagement\, and decision-making. In Experiment 2\, we focus on pilot perception of time-stamps and weather symbols in a ""change-detection"" experiment. Results: The result shows that pilots (using different weather presentations) vary considerably in their overall perception of METAR symbol change during flight. The overall group detection ranges from a virtual blindness (25% detections) to a modest detection performance (62% detections). The result from the change-detection experiment shows that the detection accuracy varies greatly between different weather symbols and between different weather presentations. Although the average change-detection performance is high across all weather presentations for precipitation areas (on average\, 89% to 94% correct detections)\, SIGMET areas (83% to 93%)\, and METAR symbols (83% to 91%)\, pilots are virtually blind to changes for lightning symbols (17% to 43%) and time-stamp information (13% to 20%).

dot:71680,,,"This report documents the first in a series of studies on the optimal design of event lists (ODELs) for Technical Operations use. The ODELs study described in this report examines whether event list format has an impact on user performance when searching for information. The stimuli consisted of four different list formats: delineated\, non-delineated\, ledger shading\, and white text on a blue background. These formats represented list formats currently in existence in the operational environment. Researchers measured task completion time\, accuracy\, and eye-scanning metrics such as number of fixations\, fixation duration\, blink frequency\, pupil diameter\, and number of reversals. Additionally\, researchers collected subjective ratings of difficulty and preference rankings for each of the four conditions.

The stimuli consisted of four different list formats: delineated\, non-delineated\, ledger shading\, and white text on a blue background. These formats represented list formats currently in existence in the operational environment. Researchers measured task completion time\, accuracy\, and eye-scanning metrics such as number of fixations\, fixation duration\, blink frequency\, pupil diameter\, and number of reversals. Additionally\, researchers collected subjective ratings of difficulty and preference rankings for each of the four conditions.

dot:78897,,,"To improve the survivability of structures it is important to understand the dynamic failure behavior under impact loading. Impact tests have revealed that mode of failure on metal superalloys thick plate at high-speed impact is what is known as Adiabatic shear band (ASB). The tabulated J-C material model is the current state of the art for FEM of high velocity impacts. The development of the tabulated J-C material model started from the consideration that materials under impact are affected by large deformations\, high strain rates\, temperature softening\, and varying stress-states and that the failure is also changing as a function of the state of stress. Validated numerical 2D simulations revealed that the current J-C material model is successful in predicting this mode of failure only under the condition of using meshes composed of elements with a size that is of the same magnitude order of the ASB width.

Department of Physics and Astronomy,FAA Technical Library,"To improve the survivability of structures it is important to understand the dynamic failure behavior under impact loading. Impact tests have revealed that mode of failure on metal superalloys thick plate at high-speed impact is what is known as Adiabatic shear band (ASB). The tabulated J-C material model is the current state of the art for FEM of high velocity impacts. The development of the tabulated J-C material model started from the consideration that materials under impact are affected by large deformations\, high strain rates\, temperature softening\, and varying stress-states and that the failure is also changing as a function of the state of stress. Validated numerical 2D simulations revealed that the current J-C material model is successful in predicting this mode of failure only under the condition of using meshes composed of elements with a size that is of the same magnitude order of the ASB width. Because the ASB width of some high-performance metal alloys is in the order of 1μm\, the material model cannot be use in practical real application to predict ASB. This thesis describes the upgrades implemented in the current Finite Element Model (FEM) of tabulated Johnson Cook (J-C) material model that allow the development of Adiabatic Shear Bands (ASBs) under the correct loading conditions in meshes with element size of practical use in current engineering applications.

This involved developing a hardware-validated flight dynamics simulation to assess different control strategies to fly Mission Task Elements (MTEs) as well as create methodologies that may one day aid and inform specific certification testing at the vehicle level. Methodologies to compute force and moment envelopes for different vehicle configurations were developed and enabled the team to predict potential control challenges\, such as situations leading to loss of control. An optimization code was created which tailored control and power outputs to optimize torque\, thrust\, moment\, or noise footprint.

The purpose of this research was to build on the progress made during Phase 1 of the project. This involved developing a hardware-validated flight dynamics simulation to assess different control strategies to fly Mission Task Elements (MTEs) as well as create methodologies that may one day aid and inform specific certification testing at the vehicle level. Methodologies to compute force and moment envelopes for different vehicle configurations were developed and enabled the team to predict potential control challenges\, such as situations leading to loss of control. An optimization code was created which tailored control and power outputs to optimize torque\, thrust\, moment\, or noise footprint. A flight test campaign was conducted to characterize each novel control strategy developed within the limitations of the vehicle’s capabilities and flying environment.",,Final Report,"Sizoo\, David; Schaller\, Ross",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dot:79775,,693KA9-21-C-00010,"The purpose of this project was to provide a data driven process to identify sensor technologies with the potential for detecting and identifying low levels of contaminants that may occasionally be present in aircraft engine bleed air supplies. Bleed air from a ground-based aircraft propulsion engine and an auxiliary power unit (APU) were used to supply air through an ozone/volatile organic compound (VOC) converter to the environmental control system on a Boeing 747\, while injecting controlled amounts of fluid contaminants (i.e.\, aircraft engine oil\, hydraulic fluid\, and deicing fluid). Measurements of contaminants were performed at the ozone/VOC converter inlet and exit\, and at the air conditioning pack exit. Ultrafine particles (UFP) were found to be a sensitive marker for engine oil contamination with measurements at all three locations showing similar\, highly elevated UFP concentrations with a mean diameter near 40nm and smaller when the sample stream was cooled to near room temperature. In situ measurements showed that UFPs are generated by condensation and high UFP concentrations were not detected in uncooled bleed air. Oil contamination VOC levels were very low upstream of the ozone/VOC converter at bleed air temperatures up to 220˚C and increased at bleed temperatures of around 315˚C; however\, oil contamination VOC levels remained at sub-ppmv levels. Fine particle concentrations also increased with oil contamination at lower bleed air temperatures\, but not with temperatures around 315 ˚C. Secondary contaminants including pentanoic acid\, heptanoic acid\, acetic acid\, formaldehyde\, and acetaldehyde formed in the ozone/VOC converter as the oil aerosol oxidized. Consideration must be given to contaminant deposition within the bleed air system and sample lines as this deposition may lead to delayed responses and contaminant release during temperature transients. Of the sensor technologies assessed\, spectrometers provided the best opportunity to detect and identify contaminants. Carbon monoxide (CO) measurements confirmed that CO is not generated in sufficient quantities to be of value as a marker for engine oil or hydraulic fluid contamination of bleed air. CO may be useful as a marker for ingestion of engine exhaust in some cases. However\, carbon dioxide (CO2) is a much better marker for engine exhaust ingestion.,The total size of the zip file is 102 MB.

dot:79357,,,"Anisotropic heterogeneous characteristics and changes in failure modes over the fatigue life as well as multiple failure mechanisms that interact with each other make it challenging to predict damage growth in composite structures. Therefore\, overly conservative assumptions (e.g. load and life factors based on lower-level building block testing) are made for fatigue life assessment without taking full advantage of the fatigue capabilities of composites. To design efficient composite structures\, a greater understanding of the fundamentals of fatigue damage initiation and growth characteristics is needed. A significant body of work on monotonic fatigue loading has been performed\, and significant milestones in predicting the damage extent of specific failure modes\, such as transverse cracking in cross-ply laminates and delamination\, have been reached. The interaction of matrix cracking and delamination under monotonic fatigue loading has also been addressed. First\, damage accumulation based on constant-amplitude (monotonic) fatigue was studied in detail with high-fidelity inspection methods. Then\, several block-spectrum configurations\, sequencing various high-\, medium-\, and low-load blocks were investigated for determining the sequencing effects. These block spectra included cases with a constant stress ratio across the spectrum as well as cases with variable stress ratios. Several key findings concerning damage initiation progression are reported for several combinations of block spectra. For the open-hole specimen configuration\, it was noted that a high load at the beginning resulted in the least damaging scenario.

Research & Technology Development Office,United States,"National Institute for Aviation Research (U.S.),Wichita State University",FAA Technical Library,"Anisotropic heterogeneous characteristics and changes in failure modes over the fatigue life as well as multiple failure mechanisms that interact with each other make it challenging to predict damage growth in composite structures. Therefore\, overly conservative assumptions (e.g. load and life factors based on lower-level building block testing) are made for fatigue life assessment without taking full advantage of the fatigue capabilities of composites. To design efficient composite structures\, a greater understanding of the fundamentals of fatigue damage initiation and growth characteristics is needed. A significant body of work on monotonic fatigue loading has been performed\, and significant milestones in predicting the damage extent of specific failure modes\, such as transverse cracking in cross-ply laminates and delamination\, have been reached. The interaction of matrix cracking and delamination under monotonic fatigue loading has also been addressed. First\, damage accumulation based on constant-amplitude (monotonic) fatigue was studied in detail with high-fidelity inspection methods. Then\, several block-spectrum configurations\, sequencing various high-\, medium-\, and low-load blocks were investigated for determining the sequencing effects. These block spectra included cases with a constant stress ratio across the spectrum as well as cases with variable stress ratios. Several key findings concerning damage initiation progression are reported for several combinations of block spectra. For the open-hole specimen configuration\, it was noted that a high load at the beginning resulted in the least damaging scenario. Supplementary studies on load-sequencing effects by altering laminate configurations\, varying stress levels\, and mixed stress ratio are also included.",,Final Report,"Pham\, Lynn",,Progressive Damage Growth of Composites under Variable-Amplitude Fatigue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although most proper disposal operations includes precise metering on the resultant deicing operation runoff into sewer systems in amounts deemed not ecologically detrimental\, this practice· is not considered a suitable solution by all. Costs associated with glycol runoff may provide additional incentive for recycling. Capturing spent glycols for recycling into aircraft usable\, certified deicing/anti-icing products or marketable glycols for nonaviation use is anticipated to ease the stress of local environs and water treatment plants. Practices and procedures addressing the recycling and reuse of these glycols are the underlying focus of this investigation. The primary objective of this study was to globally investigate and document spent glycol recycling methods and practices\, including Asian\, former Soviet bloc countries\, and other areas of the world not within the purview of current SAE/ISO fluid standards. As a minimum a combination of 140 worldwide airports\, airlines\, air carriers\, recovery vehicles suppliers\, recycling equipment vendors\, recycling equipment operators\, and vendors of equipment used for diversion and containment of spent aircraft deicing fluid (ADF) were sent questionnaires. Technical and economic information was collected from questionnaires\, vendor literature\, government reports\, communication via facsimiles\, internet e-mailings\, phone conferences\, on-site meetings\, and the experience of the author. Study results provide information associated with establishing an on-site or remote glycol recycling facility\, what can be expected from such a facility\, utilization of the refined glycol\, and a method for reprocessing into aircraft deicing/anti-icing fluid.,1199",2001-02-01,PDF,,,United States,,2021-09-13T19:45:17.001Z,,Tech Report,,United States.

Experimental operation of this system confirmed that a 3-day or less remediation cycle was possible during the winter season. This is compared to the current cycle of 3 months starting when ambient temperatures are high enough (usually April) to promote activity.,1199",1998-09-01,PDF,,,United States,,2021-09-20T19:07:45.752Z,,Tech Report,Final Report,United States.

dot:73644,,"13-C-AJFE-MIT-064\, 089","Aviation emissions cause global changes in air quality which have been estimated to result in ~58 000 premature mortalities per year\, but this number varies by an order of magnitude between studies. The causes of this uncertainty include differences in the assessment of ozone exposure impacts and in how air quality changes are simulated\, as well as the possibility that low-resolution (˘400 km) global models may overestimate impacts compared to finer-resolution (˘50 km) regional models. We use the GEOS-Chem High-Performance chemistry-transport model at a 50 km global resolution\, an order of magnitude finer than recent assessments of the same scope\, to quantify the air quality impacts of aviation with a single internally consistent global approach. We find that aviation emissions in 2015 resulted in 21 200 (95% confidence interval due to health response uncertainty: 19 400–22 900) premature mortalities due to particulate matter exposure and 53 100 (36 000–69 900) due to ozone exposure. Compared to a prior estimate of 6800 ozone-related premature mortalities for 2006 our central estimate is increased by 5.6 times due to the use of updated epidemiological data\, which includes the effects of ozone exposure during winter\, and by 1.3 times due to increased aviation fuel burn. The use of fine (50 km) resolution increases the estimated impacts on both ozone and particulate-matter-related mortality by a further 20% compared to coarse-resolution (400 km) global simulation\, but an intermediate resolution (100 km) is sufficient to capture 98% of impacts. This is in part due to the role of aviation-attributable ozone\, which is long-lived enough to mix through the Northern Hemisphere and exposure to which causes 2.5 times as much health impact as aviation-attributable PM2:5. This work shows that the air quality impacts of civil aviation emissions are dominated by the hemisphere-scale response of tropospheric ozone to aviation NOx rather than local changes and that simulations at ˘100 km resolution provide similar results to those at a 2 times finer spatial scale. However\, the overall quantification of health impacts is sensitive to assumptions regarding the response of human health to exposure\, and additional research is needed to reduce uncertainty in the physical response of the atmosphere to aviation emissions.",Active,Global Impacts of Aviation on Air Quality Evaluated at High Resolution,English,"Air travel,Airports,Climate change,Environmental impacts,Sustainable transportation,Economic impacts,ASCENT",2025-01-21T16:32:25.963Z,FAA Technical Library;Climate Change Clearinghouse,English,Global Impacts of Aviation on Air Quality Evaluated at High Resolution,acp-24-2687-2024,"Air travel,Airports,Climate change,Environmental impacts,Sustainable transportation,Economic impacts,ASCENT","United States.
