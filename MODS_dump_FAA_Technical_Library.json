Mode II stress intensity factors (SIF) were derived from superposition of the linear elastic solutions of two separate problems having different domains. The first problem considers the uncracked domain with the same prescribed vertical displacements at the bottom as the original problem. The second problem considers the cracked domain, where vertical displacements at the bottom boundary are prescribed to be zero. The sum of the solutions of these two problems in the linear elastic domain gives the desired Mode II solution at the vicinity of the crack tip. By applying Schapery’s theory of crack propagation in viscoelastic materials, this model can be used to determine the energy release rate (ERR) in and asphalt overlay subject to Mode II cracking caused by repeated aircraft traffic loads. The model was used to compute Mode II SIFs at the crack tip for a series of incremental crack lengths, using assumed properties. Computed SIF values showed good agreement with SIF values computed by a finite element model (ABAQUS)."],

These three studies provide data for a combined total of 249 flights on a variety of makes and models of aircraft. These studies provide adequate documentation of typical aircraft cabin air.

Additionally, collaboration was established with several technical committees from the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), American Society of Heating, Air-Conditioning and Refrigerating Engineers (ASHRAE), and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and with project personnel from the prior European Union Aviation Safety Administration (EASA)-funded cabin air study. Key objectives of the project were to identify sensors and sensing technology with potential for detection of one or more of the three aforementioned bleed air contaminants and to develop a plan for test stand engine experiments to evaluate the sensors with controlled amounts of the three contaminants. Sensors and instruments were identified and a test plan was developed. Additionally, through the collaboration with ASHRAE 1830 and the support of the industry working group, many of the experiments identified in the test plan were completed.

An initial set of reports were produced as DOT/FAA/AR-13/25 P1-3. This supplemental report describes additional experiments designed and conducted to answer questions that arose during the *MAT_224 card development process. The additional tests were organized into three groups: 1) Dynamic tension tests to study the conversion of plastic work into heat at high strain rates, 2) tests conducted to determine the fracture strain of 2024-T351 aluminum under a specific state of compression and shear, and 3) tests conducted to determine the material fracture strain under a certain three-dimensional stress state (inplane biaxial tension and through thickness compression). To study conversion of plastic work to heat, tension tests on miniature dog-bone coupons were conducted at strain rates ranging from 1E-4 s-1 to 6000 s-1. During the tests, full-field strain and temperature were measured on opposite sides of the sample using high speed Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and a Telops high speed thermal infrared (IR) camera, respectively. Both strain and temperature data were superposed on a common coordinate system using MATLAB-based image processing techniques; average Taylor-Quinney (Beta) parameters were then determined. To further characterize the fracture strain dependence on stress state, an additional stress state was measured via a combined compression and shear (torsion) test using an axial-torsional hydraulic load frame. The new stress state had the highest ratio of compressive to torsional stress tested to date. To study the effect of the in-plane biaxial tension plus through thickness compression on the fracture strain of Aluminum 2024-T35, a new punch test with a backing plate was designed and conducted. These new tests were based on ASTM E643-15 Standard Test Method for Ball Punch Deformation of Metallic Sheet Material. The standard tests were modified such that the ratio of the die diameter to the punch diameter was dramatically increased and in two cases, a ductile copper backing plate was added behind the aluminum test specimen, providing out-of-plane compression. Three types of tests were conducted: 1) unbacked, 2) backed test with thin copper plate and 3) backed test with thick copper plate. These tests were designed to ensure that the stress triaxiality ranged from -2/3 to 0.113 while maintaining a near constant Lode parameter of -1. Tests conducted for backed experiments included both monotonic tests to failure and sequential loading-unloading tests to analyze strain evolution and failure morphology. Fracture strains for the backed experiments were determined to be substantially higher than those from unbacked (biaxial tension only) tests."],

We found that that the Low-Var group needed the most time to dismantle the mines on a post-training test with mixed procedures. They also made more errors on initiating the procedure.

Matrix compression has been studied the least. The matrix- compression damage parameters needed for finite element simulations are not available. Matrix-tension values are typically used. While such estimates are sufficiently conservative (i.e., result in predictions of failure at lower loads than would occur and are thus “safe”) the difference from the correct matrix-compression values are unknown. Consequently, this approach may lead to overly conservative designs. The purpose of this project is to evaluate currently-used finite element methods to determine the extent to which the use of these incorrect matrix-compression damage parameters impacts simulation predictions and calculations. The method used was to determine accurate matrix-compression damage parameters, use them in simulations, and compare the outputs to those obtained from the current approach of using tensile values. Accurate matrix-compression damage parameters were determined through development of a suitable test specimen and experimental measurements. With these parameters simulations for several layups and loadings were performed with the commercial finite element package and compared to simulations using tensile values. Results showed that the appropriate matrix-compression damage material model was an energy release rate at the propagating tip of the damage region. The contribution of residual load-carrying ability in the wake of this tip (due to surface contact under compressive loading) was insignificant. Furthermore, the energy release rate was found to consist of Mode I and Mode II components of respective magnitudes of 3.42 times the currently-used tensile value and 11.88 times the currently-used tensile value. The extent to which the use of incorrect matrix-compression damage parameters impacts simulation predictions and calculations was evaluated using six layups and two loading configurations. Results showed the change in value did not significantly affect fiber-tension damage or fiber-compression damage for any layup or loading and only slightly affected Mises stress. However, the change in value did significantly affect matrix-tension damage, matrix-compression damage, and matrix-shear damage for all layups and both loadings. This report shows that the current method using a tensile value for matrix-compression damage can introduce significant errors in predictions of damage initiation and propagation in finite element simulations of carbon-fiber laminates."],

Emphasis has been placed on investigating methods and tools used to conduct analysis and predict structural performance of bonded repairs and those used to monitor and evaluate repair quality over the life of the part. This project is carried out in a phased approach where phase 1 was fixture development and verification. Phase 2 was the initial baseline testing that verified the analysis models and provided an initial reference point for inspection and monitoring systems used to detect and track damage formation. This report discusses the recent third-phase efforts to support bonded repair size limit (BRSL) studies and methods used to predict the limit-load residual strength for a failed scarfed repair in solid composite laminates with full-depth and partial-depth scarf configurations. Scarfs were inserted in carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) panels having an 18-ply quasi-isotropic layup. The panels were attached as top-side components (e.g., skins) of a cantilevered, 24-inch-wide by 40-inch-long wingbox structure. These panels were subjected to constant-moment loads tested either quasi-statically loaded to failure or subjected to fatigue before loading them to failure. The applied fatigue loading conditions simulated highest operational strain levels for transport-category wing panels for 165,000 cycles, which is approximately equal to three design service goals (DSGs). The test and analysis results revealed a significant benefit of partial-depth scarfs over full-depth scarfs. In addition, there was no debit in strength due to fatigue in both type of panels tested. For both full-depth and partial-depth scarf configurations, the methods under development for BRSL residual strength predictions correlated well with test results. Follow-on efforts are focused on panels with double-sided scarf configurations, which will be documented in a companion technical note."],

The model is driven by tabulated data that can be generated using laboratory tests or via virtual testing. The yield function is a modified form the Tsai-Wu failure model.

This report includes a review of machine learning (ML) techniques for prediction of long-term pavement performance. The study examined applicability of three ML techniques, namely artificial neural network, support vector machine, and random forest, based on FAA Extended Airport Pavement Life (EAPL) data. Two modeling approaches, namely static and autoregressive, were implemented for each ML method. Initial models were developed for pavement condition index (PCI) and for a subsidiary index based on PCI but considering only non-load-related components (designated anti-SCI) by considering pavement age as the primary predictor. The study also implemented various feature selection methods based on supervised learning techniques to determine the key environmental and traffic variables affecting the pavement performance. These methods were implemented to reduce the dimensionality of input space by identifying and removing a subset of irrelevant and redundant environmental and traffic variables. Feature construction methods based on unsupervised learning techniques, including k-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis, were also applied to reduce the dimensionality of input space by constructing new inputs. Findings from the feature selection and construction analyses were used to develop ML predictive models for the performance index anti-SCI, by implementing an autoregressive approach and using random forest as the learning algorithm."],

        "mods.abstract":["The purpose of this project was to provide a data-driven process to identify sensing technology with good potential for detecting bleed air contamination from engine oil, hydraulic fluid, or deicing fluid. Reports from major aircraft cabin air studies were reviewed to identify the range of constituents that can be expected in cabin air, especially as they pertain to the aforementioned contaminants and their potential markers. One of the projects was the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Vehicle Integrated Propulsion Research (NASA-VIPR) project where controlled amounts of engine oil were injected into the engine compressor of a C-17 transport aircraft and the resulting contaminants in the bleed air measured. Three additional cabin air quality studies conducted on revenue flights were reviewed. These three studies provide data for a combined total of 249 flights on a variety of makes and models of aircraft. These studies provide adequate documentation of typical aircraft cabin air. Information from this review was used to identify potential markers of the bleed air contaminants. Additionally, collaboration was established with several technical committees from the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), American Society of Heating, Air-Conditioning and Refrigerating Engineers (ASHRAE), and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and with project personnel from the prior European Union Aviation Safety Administration (EASA)-funded cabin air study. Key objectives of the project were to identify sensors and sensing technology with potential for detection of one or more of the three aforementioned bleed air contaminants and to develop a plan for test stand engine experiments to evaluate the sensors with controlled amounts of the three contaminants. Sensors and instruments were identified and a test plan was developed. Additionally, through the collaboration with ASHRAE 1830 and the support of the industry working group, many of the experiments identified in the test plan were completed. The analysis of the data from these experiments is ongoing and will be reported in the ASHRAE 1830 project report. However, preliminary assessment of the sensing technology has been possible."],

The first is ignition of a standard hydrogen/oxygen/argon gaseous mixture and the second is detection of light, which is a simpler and less hazardous approach. Both techniques require a 200 microjoule (μJ) minimum fuel ignition threshold induced by discharge of a standard voltage spark source. The standard defines the pass criterion either by demonstrating the absence of a minimum light detected by camera or by no ignition of the flammable gas mixture.

The FAA Aircraft Catastrophic Failure Prevention Program sponsored the development of a new material model known as MAT_213 to model composite impact, which has been implemented into the commercial finite element software LS-DYNA. This report provides results for stacked-ply T800/F3900 carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite validation tests conducted at room temperature with uniaxial tension and compression loads applied at quasi-static rates by Arizona State University. Stress concentration validation tests were also conducted on stacked-ply specimens with a centered hole. Digital Image Correlation was used to obtain the experimental surface strain contours. MAT_213 was used to conduct simulations comparing stress-strain relationships, strain profiles, and displacement results to the experiments. The MAT_213 material inputs were obtained from specimen tests performed previously. Additionally, as part of this study, delamination tests were conducted using end notch flexure and double cantilevered beam specimens to characterize mode I and mode II fracture properties of the T800/F3900 composite. These experimental results were used to build models with MAT_138 cohesive zone elements for the interlaminar polymer matrix between the composite ply layers modeled with MAT_213. The test results were necessary to calibrate numerical inputs to the traction separation laws governing the delamination behavior. Scanning electron microscope analysis was also utilized to examine specimens in the untested, damaged, and failed states. The results provided insight to the microstructural damage induced from manufacturing, specimen preparation processing, and loading of the T800/F3900 composite."],

          "Simulating uncontained engine fragment impact to composite aircraft structures requires material models, which can accurately account for the deformation, damage, and failure experienced during these highly dynamic events. The FAA Aircraft Catastrophic Failure Prevention Program sponsored the development of a new material model known as MAT_213 to model composite impact, which has been implemented into the commercial finite element software LS-DYNA. This report provides results for stacked-ply T800/F3900 carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite validation tests conducted at room temperature with uniaxial tension and compression loads applied at quasi-static rates by Arizona State University. Stress concentration validation tests were also conducted on stacked-ply specimens with a centered hole. Digital Image Correlation was used to obtain the experimental surface strain contours. MAT_213 was used to conduct simulations comparing stress-strain relationships, strain profiles, and displacement results to the experiments. The MAT_213 material inputs were obtained from specimen tests performed previously. Additionally, as part of this study, delamination tests were conducted using end notch flexure and double cantilevered beam specimens to characterize mode I and mode II fracture properties of the T800/F3900 composite. These experimental results were used to build models with MAT_138 cohesive zone elements for the interlaminar polymer matrix between the composite ply layers modeled with MAT_213. The test results were necessary to calibrate numerical inputs to the traction separation laws governing the delamination behavior. Scanning electron microscope analysis was also utilized to examine specimens in the untested, damaged, and failed states. The results provided insight to the microstructural damage induced from manufacturing, specimen preparation processing, and loading of the T800/F3900 composite.",

Under Task 4, the research team developed and executed field demonstrated plans to safely deploy several sUAS at six airports in Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, and New Jersey from December 2020 to August 2021. Red, green, and blue (RGB) optical orthophotos, digital elevation models (DEMs), hillshades derived from DEMs, and thermal orthophotos collected using several sUAS at different altitudes were analyzed for their usefulness in airfield distress detection. Based on the data analyses and results, RGB orthophotos of 1.5 mm/pixel and DEMs of 6 mm/pixel resolution, or higher, are highly recommended for airfield pavement distress detection and rating."],

Under Task 4, the research team developed and executed field demonstrated plans to safely deploy several sUAS at six airports in Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, and New Jersey from December 2020 to August 2021. Red, green, and blue (RGB) optical orthophotos, digital elevation models (DEMs), hillshades derived from DEMs, and thermal orthophotos collected using several sUAS at different altitudes were analyzed for their usefulness in airfield distress detection. Based on the data analyses and results, RGB orthophotos of 1.5 mm/pixel and DEMs of 6 mm/pixel resolution, or higher, are highly recommended for airfield pavement distress detection and rating."],

For a number of years, the FAA Small Airplane Directorate has been working with industry and academia to significantly enhance general aviation safety by introducing advances in technology, such as evolved in-cockpit warning systems and increased use of augmented flight controls, and by developing new means of compliance for the airworthiness certification standards. To give manufacturers more flexibility in how to demonstrate compliance with certification standards, and in order to stimulate the introduction of novel flight energy management and warning technologies, the envisioned means of compliance are based on certification point scores. The present project was focused on evaluating the effects of different sensory modes in angle-of-attack warning systems (visual, aural, and haptic) along with the stall characteristics of common single-engine, Part 23 aircraft, in order to develop a means of compliance. The period of performance for the project was 02/20/2017 – 09/09/2019. The proposed means of compliance combines fixed performance thresholds for coordinated stalls with a point system for uncoordinated, feet-on-the-floor stalls, longitudinal control force changes, free aircraft pitching response during configuration changes, and enhanced warning systems. The report presents the proposed means of compliance for flight characteristics of non-aerobatic level 1 to level 4 airplanes and documents the underlying flight test data. Flight tests for the characterization of angle-of-attack warning methods were executed on a fly-by-wire DA42 research aircraft developed by the Technical University of Munich and operated by Diamond Aircraft in Wiener Neustadt, Austria.

Specifically, we assessed the impact of a time-based active reminder on pilot decision-making. The active reminder indicated the amount of time in which a pilot might encroach within 20 miles of severe weather along their route. Background: In a previous study, the WTIC group evaluated a distance-based active reminder to indicate pilot proximity to severe weather. Method: Fifty private pilots participated in the study. The pilots were randomly allocated to either the 10 nm or 20 nm active reminder condition to fly in a scenario with degrading visibility conditions. Results: We found no important differences between the AR10 and AR20 groups with regards to aircraft altitude, AWOS usage, distance-to-weather, flight decision-making, and the ability of pilots to provide forward visibility estimates. This result implies that the difference in lead-time (i.e., 10 versus 20 miles) did not affect the flying behavior of pilots. Both pilot groups flew equally close to hazardous weather cells (i.e., ≥ 30 dBZ precipitation cells) with a mean distance-to-weather of 9.93 to 17.2 miles (95% HDIs). Even more striking, comparing the present distance-to-weather results with the distance-to-weather data from the Ahlstrom et al.

These materials can be subjected to different types of aeronautical fluids during their lifetime. These composites’ exposure to organic fluids such as fuels may lead to matrix swelling and degradation of the composite’s material properties. Hence, evaluating property changes as a function of fuel exposure to ensure aircraft flight safety is of paramount importance. A number of alternative jet fuels have come to focus in recent years to reduce the environmental impact of commercial aviation jet fuels. These blended jet fuels are intended to be used as drop-in fuels in aircraft since they meet existing certification limits required of conventional Jet A fuels. The effects of the following jet fuel blends were investigated in this work; 50/50 Gevo Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ)/Jet A fuel, 50/50 Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK)/Jet A, Amyris 20/80 farnesane/Jet A fuel, and 50/50 S8/Jet A. Note that the first three listed fuels are bio-derived, while the latter is derived via natural gas. The objective of this research is to determine the extent of initial fuel absorption in various composites and investigate the effect of such absorption on the composites’ glass transition temperature Tg and degradation of composite materials’ properties (storage E′ and loss moduli E” and tan δ). Specifically, the changes in Tg were identified as a function of the type of fuel, and duration of exposure. The specimens used were autoclave-cured Hexcel SGP370-8H/8552 eight-harness satin weave carbon/epoxy prepreg specimens with two layups: a four-ply [0/-45/+45/90] layup and a four-ply [0/90]s layup 2 x 0.5 in² specimens, oven-cured Jaco Aerospace & Industrial DMS 2436 Type 1 Class 72 multi-axial warp-knit dry carbon fabric infused with API-1078 epoxy with a seven-ply [45/-45/0/90/0/-45/45] layup 2 x 0.5 in² specimens, and Oven-cured Cytec T40-800 Cycom® 5215 graphite/epoxy prepreg with [0]30 layup 1.5 x 0.5 in² specimens. Specimens were vacuum-dried to remove any remaining moisture in the carbon/epoxy specimens before submersion in various fuels. Fuel-exposed specimens were periodically measured during fuel immersion to evaluate mass gain and when fuel uptake saturation occurs. After a final weighing, fuel- saturated specimens were used in dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to investigate of fuel absorption effect on composites’ Tg and dynamic mechanical properties."],

This survey was used to identify potential shortfalls in the certification of bonded structures. We reviewed, summarized, and compiled investigation reports, safety recommendations, and airworthiness directives associated with bond failure-related events. These documents originated mainly from countries with large civil aviation fleets that maintain online, publicly available databases. This survey was limited to typecertified, civil aeronautical products, irrespective of the manufacturer, model, size, or age. A total of 73 bond-related events involving aircraft registered in 13 countries on five continents were found. We grouped these events according to the aeronautical product—transport airplanes, general aviation airplanes, rotorcraft, propellers, and engines—containing the failed bonded joint. Each of these groups is type-certified under specific airworthiness requirements. For each event, we classified the bond failure’s root causes into the following categories: design, production, operation, and maintenance. Analysis of the compiled data revealed that maintenance or production issues often contributed to the reviewed bond-related events. This analysis also emphasized the need for process control/validation and durability substantiation to ensure the long-term safe operation of bonded structures. The data supports a conclusion that no additional layer of protection—e.g., load path redundancy, damage growth arrest features, environmental protection measures, damage tolerance-based maintenance actions, or advanced nondestructive inspections—can alone guarantee the expected joint structural performance in case of substandard bonding without adequate material and process control. These observations are consistent with current certification guidance materials."],

The research measured the effectiveness of using a prototype Bird UVLEDs integrated into a PAR46 landing light to trigger bird avoidance behavioral responses, which would increase flight path separation to reduce the incidence of bird strikes. The first set of field trials involved a one-quarter scale remote controlled (RC) plane. The second set of field trials involved an AirTractor 802 aircraft performing flight operations, with nominal flight speeds of 150 kt and < 100’ above ground level (AGL), in the performance of agricultural chemical delivery. Concrete examples are illustrated throughout the report to make the concepts clear. Field data of measured bird responses to the deterrence device ON/OFF condition of the PAR46 with UVLED landing light was statistically modeled for correlation with environmental conditions. The environmental flight conditions were recalculated to determine the SNR (signal to noise ratio) of the bird’s visual system to the approaching plane, corresponding to the time of change in bird behavior identified as flight direction, altitude, or speed as recorded by an on-board video camera. The camera was mounted in the cockpit of an AirTractor air vehicle with a majority of plane-bird interactions occurring at 3-10m AGL with an airspeed of 150 kt. The three empirically derived variables (V1, V2, and V3) of the model correspond to three sequential steps involved in visual processing as presented by modern neurophysiological research. The SNR of the air vehicle to the background brightness of the sky is a key factor incorporated in the model that differentiates the predicted distance of the birds’ distance of change in flight direction, altitude, or speed. Multiple species of birds were involved in these field trials, which benefited from the ON condition of the prototype (PAR46 size) landing light that incorporated UVLEDs. Differences of reaction distance were measured for various species, which may be uniquely associated with the species neurophysiological functions."],

        "mods.abstract":["A Dissertation Presented in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. An orthotropic elasto-plastic damage material model (OEPDMM) suitable for impact simulations has been developed through a joint research project funded by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Development of the model includes derivation of the theoretical details, implementation of the theory into LS-DYNA®, a commercially available nonlinear transient dynamic finite element code, as material model MAT 213, and verification and validation of the model. The material model is comprised of three major components: deformation, damage, and failure. The deformation sub-model is used to capture both linear and nonlinear deformations through a classical plasticity formulation. The damage sub-model is used to account for the reduction of elastic stiffness of the material as the degree of plastic strain is increased. Finally, the failure sub-model is used to predict the onset of loss of load carrying capacity in the material. OEPDMM is driven completely by tabulated experimental data obtained through physically meaningful material characterization tests, through high fidelity virtual tests, or both. The tabulated data includes stress-strain curves at different temperatures and strain rates to drive the deformation sub-model, damage parameter-total strain curves to drive the damage sub-model, and the failure sub-model can be driven by the data required for different failure theories implemented in the computer code. The work presented herein focuses on the experiments used to obtain the data necessary to drive as well as validate the material model, development and implementation of the damage model, verification of the deformation and damage models through single element (SE) and multi-element (ME) finite element simulations, development and implementation of experimental procedure for modeling delamination, and finally validation of the material model through low speed impact simulations and high speed impact simulations."],

        "dc.description":["A Dissertation Presented in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. An orthotropic elasto-plastic damage material model (OEPDMM) suitable for impact simulations has been developed through a joint research project funded by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Development of the model includes derivation of the theoretical details, implementation of the theory into LS-DYNA®, a commercially available nonlinear transient dynamic finite element code, as material model MAT 213, and verification and validation of the model. The material model is comprised of three major components: deformation, damage, and failure. The deformation sub-model is used to capture both linear and nonlinear deformations through a classical plasticity formulation. The damage sub-model is used to account for the reduction of elastic stiffness of the material as the degree of plastic strain is increased. Finally, the failure sub-model is used to predict the onset of loss of load carrying capacity in the material. OEPDMM is driven completely by tabulated experimental data obtained through physically meaningful material characterization tests, through high fidelity virtual tests, or both. The tabulated data includes stress-strain curves at different temperatures and strain rates to drive the deformation sub-model, damage parameter-total strain curves to drive the damage sub-model, and the failure sub-model can be driven by the data required for different failure theories implemented in the computer code. The work presented herein focuses on the experiments used to obtain the data necessary to drive as well as validate the material model, development and implementation of the damage model, verification of the deformation and damage models through single element (SE) and multi-element (ME) finite element simulations, development and implementation of experimental procedure for modeling delamination, and finally validation of the material model through low speed impact simulations and high speed impact simulations."],

According to a 1997 summary from the AIA Rotor Integrity Sub-Committee, about 25% of recent rotor cracks/events have been caused by post-forging manufacturing induced anomalies. The guidelines contained herein represent an industry consensus on the currently available best practices to minimize manufacturing induced anomalies in critical rotating parts consistent with the AIA RoMan team charter and vision. Recommendations for nominal rotor manufacturing process development and control, including process validation, quality assurance, disposition of suspect parts, process monitoring, human factors and training, and non-destructive evaluation, are included to provide an overall framework for a highly reliable manufacturing process. Because critical rotating part reliability has demonstrated particular sensitivity to hole machining practices, specific recommendations for hole making are included. In addition, a section containing industry lessons learned is included to provide guidance on issues common in the industry. The term lessons learned generally refers to useful pieces of practical wisdom acquired by experience or study. Appendices are attached which include the team charter and vision and detailed information concerning process monitoring of holes and non-destructive evaluation."],

More specifically, multiple researchers have shown that looseness of dowel bars greatly affects responses of Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement and its performance due to the reduction in load-transfer efficiency. Aware of the relevance of joint efficiency, researchers have used multiple approaches to include it in analyses: closed-form solutions, finite element (FE) analysis, and response from pavement instrumentation. This study combines the three approaches to consider the effect of joint continuity on temperature responses of airfield rigid pavement. Curling and blowup analysis was performed on airfield rigid pavement, considering generalized boundary conditions. The analysis combined closed-form solutions, FE methods, and pavement instrumentation. Closed-form solutions were derived for the curling responses and stability analysis (i.e., pavement blowup) for a slab-on-grade pavement with partially restrained edges. The closed-form solutions were verified using the FE method. Furthermore, an FE model validated with experimental measurements was used to study the influence of joint condition on the responses to temperature of a multilayer airfield rigid pavement. In general, curling responses and blowup load are significantly affected by the continuity along a slab’s edges. Joint condition is more relevant for short slabs, and that aspect ratio is relevant when there is good continuity among slabs. Although conventional analysis does not consider a slab’s rotational continuity along the joints, this variable is more relevant than continuity of vertical displacement. Finally, the relevance of rotational continuity increases as the capacity to transfer vertical displacement increases."],

        "mods.abstract":["The evolution of aircraft design and construction has brought about new challenges to Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) personnel. The New Large Aircraft (NLA) entering the market have introduced increased passenger capacities, fuel loads, hydraulic pressures, and the use of advance composite materials. The most significant change is the introduction of the full-length, upper-passenger deck on the Airbus A380 with certification for up to 853 total passengers. Although the full upper-passenger deck and unique characteristics of the A380 served as the initial motivator for this research effort, various NLA were ultimately included. This report identifies a number of changes that may affect firefighting tactics and strategies involving NLA. The Airbus A350, A380, Boeing (B)-747-8I, B-777, B-787 and A350 aircraft are discussed in this report. Many of the firefighting tactics and strategies outlined are applicable to any aircraft. This report also examines case studies of previous incidents involving multilevel aircraft. This includes research conducted in relevant areas such as aircraft evacuations and advanced composite materials.

          "The evolution of aircraft design and construction has brought about new challenges to Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) personnel. The New Large Aircraft (NLA) entering the market have introduced increased passenger capacities, fuel loads, hydraulic pressures, and the use of advance composite materials. The most significant change is the introduction of the full-length, upper-passenger deck on the Airbus A380 with certification for up to 853 total passengers. Although the full upper-passenger deck and unique characteristics of the A380 served as the initial motivator for this research effort, various NLA were ultimately included. This report identifies a number of changes that may affect firefighting tactics and strategies involving NLA. The Airbus A350, A380, Boeing (B)-747-8I, B-777, B-787 and A350 aircraft are discussed in this report. Many of the firefighting tactics and strategies outlined are applicable to any aircraft. This report also examines case studies of previous incidents involving multilevel aircraft. This includes research conducted in relevant areas such as aircraft evacuations and advanced composite materials. In addition, accepted interior firefighting models were applied to the unique NLA configurations, thereby providing guidance for emergency planning of such events. This report provides a discussion of the primary topics, such as agent quantity, aircraft systems, and components, which are pertinent to NLA firefighting strategies. Configurations and aspects of NLA layouts that require strategic consideration, and influence ARFF tactical decisions and response preplanning are discussed in this report, as well as recommendations for best practices in NLA firefighting strategies.",

        "mods.abstract":["This research identifies ways to identify and mitigate obsolescence risks in avionics and to provide related aviation safety input to the Federal Aviation Administration for the development of regulations, policy, guidance, and training. Obsolescence and obsolescence management of avionics products are a technically challenging and costly financial problem with many adverse business impacts for both the avionics suppliers and their customers. Though obsolescence is not unique to the aerospace industry, it presents special problems because of the typically long life cycle of aircraft and a requirement to comply with airworthiness regulations that make continuous change complex and costly. Obsolescence is the inevitable consequence of the dependence of aerospace on a supply base whose major markets are outside of aerospace and whose technology life cycles are much shorter than those of other markets. Aerospace has a continual demand for technological progress in aircraft system capabilities and safety improvements, but on a much longer timescale than the technology turnover timescale of the supply base. Obsolescence is an inevitable occurrence; therefore, the goal of obsolescence and lifecycle management is to minimize the recurring cost impacts and the disruption of supply to customers while maintaining continued airworthiness and regulatory compliance. This report describes the current state of obsolescence management in the aerospace industry; the processes, standards, and tools now being used; and the underlying causes. The report addresses the identification, mitigation, and avoidance of issues related to obsolescence in systems, software, and airborne electronic hardware development; the related design assurance and certification considerations; and optimal methods for life-cycle maintenance and technical refreshment. The report identifies known and emerging obstacles, problems, issues, and gaps in existing standards and guidance; proposes standards and assurance techniques that may minimize the impact of obsolescence; and suggests how manufacturers can proactively plan and manage the life cycle of their products. The report describes the extant research on numerical methods for obsolescence risk assessment and related economic modeling, and provides recommendations for further public guidance and standards that would assist industry and users in adapting to a dynamic environment. The report suggests some industry and regulatory practices that could promote best practices; reduce costs and inconvenience; and improve the product life-cycle planning process. Finally, the report suggests some relevant research topics that are not well addressed presently and should be considered for future work. The report suggests that the obsolescence problem cannot be solved only by engineering methods, but also requires proactive measures and risk-awareness planning by both customers and suppliers. Obsolescence is a complex mix of engineering, economic, and business issues with many associated uncertainties. These uncertainties arise from the supply base and the customer base, which require marketing, engineering, and economic planning and analysis using numerical risk-assessment methods that measure uncertainty."],

          "This research identifies ways to identify and mitigate obsolescence risks in avionics and to provide related aviation safety input to the Federal Aviation Administration for the development of regulations, policy, guidance, and training. Obsolescence and obsolescence management of avionics products are a technically challenging and costly financial problem with many adverse business impacts for both the avionics suppliers and their customers. Though obsolescence is not unique to the aerospace industry, it presents special problems because of the typically long life cycle of aircraft and a requirement to comply with airworthiness regulations that make continuous change complex and costly. Obsolescence is the inevitable consequence of the dependence of aerospace on a supply base whose major markets are outside of aerospace and whose technology life cycles are much shorter than those of other markets. Aerospace has a continual demand for technological progress in aircraft system capabilities and safety improvements, but on a much longer timescale than the technology turnover timescale of the supply base. Obsolescence is an inevitable occurrence; therefore, the goal of obsolescence and lifecycle management is to minimize the recurring cost impacts and the disruption of supply to customers while maintaining continued airworthiness and regulatory compliance. This report describes the current state of obsolescence management in the aerospace industry; the processes, standards, and tools now being used; and the underlying causes. The report addresses the identification, mitigation, and avoidance of issues related to obsolescence in systems, software, and airborne electronic hardware development; the related design assurance and certification considerations; and optimal methods for life-cycle maintenance and technical refreshment. The report identifies known and emerging obstacles, problems, issues, and gaps in existing standards and guidance; proposes standards and assurance techniques that may minimize the impact of obsolescence; and suggests how manufacturers can proactively plan and manage the life cycle of their products. The report describes the extant research on numerical methods for obsolescence risk assessment and related economic modeling, and provides recommendations for further public guidance and standards that would assist industry and users in adapting to a dynamic environment. The report suggests some industry and regulatory practices that could promote best practices; reduce costs and inconvenience; and improve the product life-cycle planning process. Finally, the report suggests some relevant research topics that are not well addressed presently and should be considered for future work. The report suggests that the obsolescence problem cannot be solved only by engineering methods, but also requires proactive measures and risk-awareness planning by both customers and suppliers. Obsolescence is a complex mix of engineering, economic, and business issues with many associated uncertainties. These uncertainties arise from the supply base and the customer base, which require marketing, engineering, and economic planning and analysis using numerical risk-assessment methods that measure uncertainty.",

        "mods.abstract":["As a part of the FAA’s Aircraft Catastrophic Failure Prevention Program, advanced material models have been developed to improve the numerical modeling of turbine engine blade-out events. In this effort, NASA conducted four ballistic impact tests on large flat Aluminum 2024 panels with a blade-shaped Titanium 6Al-4V projectile to provide experimental data to evaluate the numerical material models. These tests were designed to represent the release of a metallic turbine engine fan blade. When the tip of a released metallic fan blade makes contact with the engine case the tip skates as the blade bends and rotates, causing the heavy blade root to impact, and potentially penetrate, the engine case. The ballistic impact tests were simulated using advanced Aluminum 2024 and Titanium 6Al-4V material model parameters previously developed in this research in conjunction with LS-DYNA’s *MAT_224 constitutive material model. The simulations validate these material models under more realistic turbine engine blade release event conditions and identify possible challenges for such a ballistic impact simulation with a blade-shaped projectile that slides, bends, plastically deforms, and rotates in three dimensions. Half-symmetric and full FE models were created using 0.01-inch elements. These models contained over 41 million and 82 million solid elements, respectively. Overall, the ballistic impact simulations showed results similar to the tests in terms of the panel deformation and blade behavior, and could predict the panel perforation. However, generic limitations of the simulation, such as use of element erosion, resulted in the absence of wear debris, which necessitated adjusting contact friction coefficients to correlate with test results. This accommodation would be anticipated to affect the wear mark size, crack propagation, and petal size in the simulations."],

          "As a part of the FAA’s Aircraft Catastrophic Failure Prevention Program, advanced material models have been developed to improve the numerical modeling of turbine engine blade-out events. In this effort, NASA conducted four ballistic impact tests on large flat Aluminum 2024 panels with a blade-shaped Titanium 6Al-4V projectile to provide experimental data to evaluate the numerical material models. These tests were designed to represent the release of a metallic turbine engine fan blade. When the tip of a released metallic fan blade makes contact with the engine case the tip skates as the blade bends and rotates, causing the heavy blade root to impact, and potentially penetrate, the engine case. The ballistic impact tests were simulated using advanced Aluminum 2024 and Titanium 6Al-4V material model parameters previously developed in this research in conjunction with LS-DYNA’s *MAT_224 constitutive material model. The simulations validate these material models under more realistic turbine engine blade release event conditions and identify possible challenges for such a ballistic impact simulation with a blade-shaped projectile that slides, bends, plastically deforms, and rotates in three dimensions. Half-symmetric and full FE models were created using 0.01-inch elements. These models contained over 41 million and 82 million solid elements, respectively.

Past Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) studies have found that released oxidizers can exacerbate burning within a halon-suppressed cargo compartment fire, potentially overwhelming the fire suppression system within an aircraft. Recently, a request was submitted to ship medical devices containing small quantities of gaseous nitrous oxide (N2O). As part of the certification process, the manufacturer of this device completed the PHMSA-required thermal resistance and flame penetration tests; however, the packaging was unable to pass the thermal resistance portion of the required tests and small quantities of N2O were able to escape. As a result of these initial tests, the manufacturer requested an exemption from this requirement. PHMSA requested assistance from the FAA Fire Safety Branch to determine if quantities of released N2O would significantly impact a cargo compartment fire. Although N2O is not flammable, it is an oxidizing agent that could exacerbate an otherwise controlled cargo compartment fire, and ultimately overwhelm the integrity of the suppression and containment capabilities of the system. Tests were conducted within an aircraft lower deck (LD-3) sized steel test chamber using a fire load of eighteen cardboard boxes filled with shredded paper. During each test, the shredded paper was ignited and the ensuing fire was allowed to develop. Two baseline tests were first conducted, in which the fire within the test chamber was allowed to burn unabated, without introducing N2O. Three subsequent tests were conducted in which various quantities of N2O gas (5.8 oz, 11.6 oz, and 17.4 oz) were released into the test chamber once the fire was fully developed. Results indicated that released quantities of N2O less than or equal to 11.6 oz did not produce a significant reaction within the fire in the test chamber. However, it was observed that as the quantity of released N2O increased, more significant combustion reactions occurred. Therefore, until further data is acquired, it is recommended that the amount of N2O be limited to no more than 11.6 oz per Unit Load Device (ULD) for air transport."],

Research shows that airport geometry can contribute to RIs. The FAA provides airports with guidance on recommended taxiway layouts in both Advisory Circular 150/5300-13 and Engineering Brief Number 75. Airport layouts not conforming to these recommendations may lead to pilot confusion and ultimately, RIs. The FAA launched the Runway Incursion Mitigation (RIM) program in fiscal year (FY) 2015 in an effort to mitigate the nonstandard geometry factors present at airport locations that experienced a high number of RIs. The FAA maintains a RIM program database updated on an annual basis, including only towered airports. During each annual update, all RIs (pilot deviation (PD) and vehicle/pedestrian deviation (V/PD)) and surface incidents from the previous calendar year (CY), including wrong surface landings and takeoffs, are georeferenced in the geographic information system database. An annual review of the layout of each airport determines if locations with previously identified nonstandard geometry characteristics have changed and/or been mitigated. New locations with nonstandard geometry characteristics are also identified. If a location has three or more RIs that occur in a CY, or cumulative incursion counts that average one or more RIs per year of data analyzed, it is considered for inclusion in the RIM inventory. Since the 2019 database update, cumulative incursion analyses are limited to the previous 10 calendar years of available RI data (e.g., 2010-2019). This report captures the RIM program summary through FY2020, annual updates, and current inventory. Since initiation of the RIM program in FY2015, a total of 7,826 RIs (PD and V/PD) and 185 nonstandard geometry locations were added to the database, bringing the total to 12,925 RIs and 6,286 nonstandard geometry locations. At the end of FY2020, there were 134 locations in the RIM inventory at 79 airports and 63 locations mitigated since the program’s inception. Airports utilized a variety of mitigation strategies to eliminate the problematic geometry characteristics or reduce their effect at these locations. Mitigation strategies include modifications to airport geometry, changes to lighting, markings, or signage, or changes to procedures or operations."],

Since initiation of the RIM program in FY2015, a total of 7,826 RIs (PD and V/PD) and 185 nonstandard geometry locations were added to the database, bringing the total to 12,925 RIs and 6,286 nonstandard geometry locations. At the end of FY2020, there were 134 locations in the RIM inventory at 79 airports and 63 locations mitigated since the program’s inception. Airports utilized a variety of mitigation strategies to eliminate the problematic geometry characteristics or reduce their effect at these locations. Mitigation strategies include modifications to airport geometry, changes to lighting, markings, or signage, or changes to procedures or operations.",

The second volume contains results of Mode I fatigue testing, and the third volume contains supplemental results of Mode I static testing of sandwich variables not tested in Volume I. In this volume, the influence of sandwich parameters, such as facesheet thickness, core type, cell size, and core density, on the onset of damage growth of sandwich composites was investigated using single-cantilever beam static testing for Mode I fracture toughness of the core-facesheet disbond. To investigate the influence of fluid ingression and entrapped fluids in sandwich structures, test specimens were conditioned in a hydraulic oil (i.e., Skydrol®) and water mixture. The fluid ingression and facesheet thickness of all the studied variables increased fracture toughness significantly. Other variables, such as cell size, core type, and core density, had a minimal effect on fracture toughness. The information gathered through this research will be instrumental in developing analytical methods and validating finite element analysis procedures to further investigate the damage growth mechanics in composite sandwich structures. The data can also be used in the design of sandwich structures constructed of similar materials and geometries tested here."],

The second prediction model utilized a machine-learning (ML) algorithm to predict pavement responses under aircraft and environmental loadings.

This report describes a newly developed orthotropic material model that has three distinct sub-models for deformation, damage, and failure of general composites. This model has been implemented in the commercial finite element program—LS-DYNA—as *MAT_213 (*MAT_COMPOSITE_TABULATED_PLASTICITY _DAMAGE). Tabulated data can be generated for this model using laboratory tests or via virtual testing. The yield function is a modified form of the Tsai-Wu failure model. A non-associated plastic flow is used. Rate and temperature dependence are supported along with tension-compression asymmetric behavior. The damage sub-model enables uncoupled and coupled parameters to be defined. Strain equivalence between the true and the effective stress space permits decoupling of the plasticity and damage calculations. The failure modeling is currently being enhanced, however, the initial version in this report describes some of the most commonly used failure criteria, including principal strain, Tsai-Wu, and a generalized tabulated laminate failure criterion. Part 1 describes the experimental procedures and results from characterizing a widely used aerospace composite–T800- F3900. Part 2 discusses the theory, implementation, verification, and validation of the MAT213 material model using the T800- F3900 composite as a test case. Verification tests are carried out using single and multiple element models. Validation tests are carried out using data from impact tests carried out at NASA-GRC, which involve T800-F3900 composite panels. Part 3 discusses the probabilistic modeling implementation in LS-DYNA to support MAT213 (via *DEFINE_STOCHASTIC_VARIATION_MAT213) and compares the results from deterministic and probabilistic modeling of impact events."],

The LS-DYNA model of the F28 was originally developed from an existing NASTRAN loads model and was validated through test-analysis comparisons with data from a full-scale crash test of the F28 onto soil. The F28 aircraft was simulated for the Flight 1549 impact conditions, not to precisely predict the response of the Airbus A320 aircraft used for that flight, but to evaluate tools for simulating and analyzing water impact for a realistic aircraft ditching event. Impact conditions were: Vx (longitudinal velocity) = 211 ft/s (2,532 in/s) and Vz (vertical velocity) = 12.5 ft/s (150 in/s). The impact attitude was: Roll = 0.0°, Pitch (nose up) = 9.5°, and Yaw = 0.0°. This Fluid-Structure Interaction simulation was executed using the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) capability in LS-DYNA. Results are presented in several categories including seat base and airframe accelerations; model kinematic responses, impact sequences, and damage evaluation; and occupant responses and injury risk assessment. Findings show that predicted seat base and airframe accelerations in both the vertical and longitudinal directions are relatively low, 15-g or less, resulting in a fairly benign impact event. Likewise, simulations of the occupant breakout models predicted injury risk values well below the defined safety limits for dynamic loading certification. These results indicate that the LS-DYNA model was able to replicate the US Airways Flight 1549 ditching event."],

The guidance in this AC provides technical procedures to quantify surface irregularities and to determine how surface irregularities may affect specific categories of airplanes.” The AC was a first step towards defining and implementing basic pavement roughness criteria for airfield pavements. The criteria presented in this early version was for single-event bump roughness. It was recognized that there was a technical need to address harmonics or multiple-bump event roughness. The research results contained in the report are in response to that technical need. A method has been developed that locates and quantifies multiple-event roughness using measured profile data only. The method works for taxiways as well as runways. In addition, a “screening” process was developed to quickly categorize pavements as acceptable, excessive, or unacceptable. Excessive or unacceptable pavement sections can then be evaluated for potential corrective action."],

          "FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 150/5380-9 “provides guidelines and procedures for measuring and evaluating runway roughness as identified by surface profile data of rigid and flexible airport pavements. The guidance in this AC provides technical procedures to quantify surface irregularities and to determine how surface irregularities may affect specific categories of airplanes.” The AC was a first step towards defining and implementing basic pavement roughness criteria for airfield pavements. The criteria presented in this early version was for single-event bump roughness. It was recognized that there was a technical need to address harmonics or multiple-bump event roughness. The research results contained in the report are in response to that technical need. A method has been developed that locates and quantifies multiple-event roughness using measured profile data only. The method works for taxiways as well as runways. In addition, a “screening” process was developed to quickly categorize pavements as acceptable, excessive, or unacceptable. Excessive or unacceptable pavement sections can then be evaluated for potential corrective action."],

A combustible constituent may be an adhesive, potting compound, film, fiber, resin, coating, binder, paint, etc., formulated with a new flame retardant, pigment, etc., that is used in the construction of a cabin material and can be tested in the MCC at the milligram scale. The use of ASTM D7309 for high precision measurements of aircraft cabin materials for regulatory purposes required a level of accuracy and reproducibility that was beyond the capability of the 2013 version of the ASTM D7309 standard when the FAA-Industry task group was formed. At the time, the calculation of the flammability characteristics did not include a correction for baseline drift- which can be a significant source of error for low flammability aircraft cabin materials. The calculation of the calorimeter signal was revised in 2019 to include the effect of combustion gases, which improved the accuracy of the flammability parameters, and was codified as ASTM D7309-19 and later versions. Correction for baseline drift was complicated by random fluctuations of the MCC signal that precluded the subtraction of a pre-recorded background signal, as is routine in thermal analysis. This report describes an analytic approach to baseline correction that is specific to the MCC and can be used to correct the calorimeter signal for temperature-dependent drift during the test to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of MCC flammability parameters of combustible materials."],

        "dc.description":["The aircraft industry in partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) formed a task group in 2013 to consider using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D7309 “Standard Test Method for Determining Flammability Characteristics of Plastics and Other Combustible Solid Materials Using Microscale Combustion Calorimetry” (MCC) as an alternate means of complying with 14 CFR 25 flammability regulations when a combustible constituent of a certified cabin construction is changed due to availability, economics, performance, or environmental concerns. A combustible constituent may be an adhesive, potting compound, film, fiber, resin, coating, binder, paint, etc., formulated with a new flame retardant, pigment, etc., that is used in the construction of a cabin material and can be tested in the MCC at the milligram scale. The use of ASTM D7309 for high precision measurements of aircraft cabin materials for regulatory purposes required a level of accuracy and reproducibility that was beyond the capability of the 2013 version of the ASTM D7309 standard when the FAA-Industry task group was formed. At the time, the calculation of the flammability characteristics did not include a correction for baseline drift- which can be a significant source of error for low flammability aircraft cabin materials. The calculation of the calorimeter signal was revised in 2019 to include the effect of combustion gases, which improved the accuracy of the flammability parameters, and was codified as ASTM D7309-19 and later versions. Correction for baseline drift was complicated by random fluctuations of the MCC signal that precluded the subtraction of a pre-recorded background signal, as is routine in thermal analysis. This report describes an analytic approach to baseline correction that is specific to the MCC and can be used to correct the calorimeter signal for temperature-dependent drift during the test to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of MCC flammability parameters of combustible materials."],

For this work, a 65-percent-scale version—CRM65—was used as the full-scale baseline airplane geometry. Ice-accretion testing was conducted in the Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) at the NASA Glenn Research Center using three hybrid swept-wing models representing three different stations along the span of the CRM65 wing. The three-dimensional (3D) ice-accretion geometries obtained from these test campaigns were used to evaluate the results of NASA and ONERA 3D icing simulation tools (LEWICE3D and IGLOO3D)."],

In recent years, hydronic and/or electrically conductive concrete (ECON) heated pavement systems (HPS) are receiving attention for mitigating problems associated with the presence of ice/snow on roadways and paved areas of airfields. The need to investigate and/or develop new technologies to best automate and accelerate the construction of large-scale heated pavements at airports is imperative. In this study, a detailed review of advanced pavement construction techniques and practices was conducted to evaluate their efficacy and applicability to construction of HPS at airports. System requirements of ECON and hydronic HPS were identified, and laboratory experimental investigations were performed to study their efficiency and performance results, leading to the development of a design procedure for large-scale HPS at airports. Advanced construction techniques and workflows, viz., precast concrete pavement, two-lift paving, and concrete overlays, for heated pavements were demonstrated through three-dimensional (3D) visualizations to provide design and construction guidance for large-scale heated pavement at airports. A 3D finite element model was developed for ECON that can be used as a cost-effective evaluation tool for examining the effects of various design parameters on the time-dependent heating performance of ECON HPS design optimization."],

          "Ice and snow accumulations on paved surfaces in airports have the potential to cause flight delays and/or cancellations, pavement deterioration, and safety concerns. In recent years, hydronic and/or electrically conductive concrete (ECON) heated pavement systems (HPS) are receiving attention for mitigating problems associated with the presence of ice/snow on roadways and paved areas of airfields. The need to investigate and/or develop new technologies to best automate and accelerate the construction of large-scale heated pavements at airports is imperative. In this study, a detailed review of advanced pavement construction techniques and practices was conducted to evaluate their efficacy and applicability to construction of HPS at airports. System requirements of ECON and hydronic HPS were identified, and laboratory experimental investigations were performed to study their efficiency and performance results, leading to the development of a design procedure for large-scale HPS at airports. Advanced construction techniques and workflows, viz., precast concrete pavement, two-lift paving, and concrete overlays, for heated pavements were demonstrated through three-dimensional (3D) visualizations to provide design and construction guidance for large-scale heated pavement at airports. A 3D finite element model was developed for ECON that can be used as a cost-effective evaluation tool for examining the effects of various design parameters on the time-dependent heating performance of ECON HPS design optimization."],

In the first two phases of this project, we evaluated the effects of liquid chemical disinfectants on materials used in aircraft seats and other interior applications. In the third phase of this project, long-term exposure to UV-C irradiation on various aircraft cabin interior materials has been investigated. In this study, eight different materials typically used in aircraft interiors, including seats, were considered. Three UV-C irradiation configurations with peak emissions at 222 nm, 253.4 nm, and 280 nm were selected. The test materials were subjected to accelerated UV-C aging tests at multiple cumulative dosage configurations, representing a single daily exposure over a time period of one, four, and eight years. Post the UV-C exposure, the materials were evaluated for change in weight, color, flammability performance, and mechanical properties."],

The disinfectant procedures included conventional chemical liquid disinfectants and Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) germicidal irradiation. In the first two phases of this project, we evaluated the effects of liquid chemical disinfectants on materials used in aircraft seats and other interior applications. In the third phase of this project, long-term exposure to UV-C irradiation on various aircraft cabin interior materials has been investigated. In this study, eight different materials typically used in aircraft interiors, including seats, were considered. Three UV-C irradiation configurations with peak emissions at 222 nm, 253.4 nm, and 280 nm were selected. The test materials were subjected to accelerated UV-C aging tests at multiple cumulative dosage configurations, representing a single daily exposure over a time period of one, four, and eight years. Post the UV-C exposure, the materials were evaluated for change in weight, color, flammability performance, and mechanical properties."],

A proposed standardized test method was used to assess the combustion hazard from a lithium-ion battery that has undergone thermal runaway. Lithium cobalt oxide pouch cells (3.7 V, 4.8 Ah) and cylindrical cells (3.7 V, 2.6 Ah) were tested at various states of charge (SOCs) and heating rates. The cells were individually heated to induce thermal runaway inside of a pressure vessel, resulting in a venting of gases. The vent gases were analyzed for their constituent’s volume, overall gas volume, and combustion energy. Key findings are as follows: • The vent gas volume and combustion energy increased linearly with SOC for the pouch and cylindrical cells. • The top three constituents as a percentage of the vent gas by volume across all SOCs and heating rates for the pouch and cylindrical cells were carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide. • The vent gas volume and combustion energy increased with the heating rate for the pouch and cylindrical cells. • When comparing cells heated at 20 °C/min to cells heated at 5 °C/min, across the tested SOCs, the pouch cells released an average of 14.1% more vent gas and had an average of 34.4% greater combustion energy, the cylindrical released an average of 7.2% more vent gas and had an average of 13.0% greater combustion energy. This data suggests that the heating rate should be standardized for lithium battery combustion hazard analysis."],

        "dc.description":["This research seeks to support the United Nations (UN) Subcommittee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (SCOE TDG) establish a more performance-based approach to classifying the various types of lithium-ion batteries for transportation. A proposed standardized test method was used to assess the combustion hazard from a lithium-ion battery that has undergone thermal runaway. Lithium cobalt oxide pouch cells (3.7 V, 4.8 Ah) and cylindrical cells (3.7 V, 2.6 Ah) were tested at various states of charge (SOCs) and heating rates. The cells were individually heated to induce thermal runaway inside of a pressure vessel, resulting in a venting of gases. The vent gases were analyzed for their constituent’s volume, overall gas volume, and combustion energy. Key findings are as follows: • The vent gas volume and combustion energy increased linearly with SOC for the pouch and cylindrical cells. • The top three constituents as a percentage of the vent gas by volume across all SOCs and heating rates for the pouch and cylindrical cells were carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide. • The vent gas volume and combustion energy increased with the heating rate for the pouch and cylindrical cells. • When comparing cells heated at 20 °C/min to cells heated at 5 °C/min, across the tested SOCs, the pouch cells released an average of 14.1% more vent gas and had an average of 34.4% greater combustion energy, the cylindrical released an average of 7.2% more vent gas and had an average of 13.0% greater combustion energy. This data suggests that the heating rate should be standardized for lithium battery combustion hazard analysis."],

While pavement distresses caused by environmental conditions cannot be prevented, early and routine maintenance work can minimize the deterioration. The current practice for airport pavement inspections relies on time-consuming visual surveys and manual interpretation of reports and sketches prepared by inspectors in the field. Recently, the use of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) has attracted attention as an option for performing cost-effective and efficient pavement inspections. In this study, the research team deployed several sUAS at different altitudes at six airports in Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, and New Jersey from December 2020 to November 2021. Red, green, and blue (RGB) optical orthophotos, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), hillshades from DEMs, and thermal orthophotos collected using several sUAS at different altitudes were analyzed for their usefulness in airfield distress detection. The results showed that RGB optical data could detect as many as 13 Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement distresses out of 14 available in this study and 6 out of 9 asphalt concrete (AC) pavement distresses available on the airports. Similarly, DEMs were found to be useful for confirming the location of distresses with elevation change, such as faulting in PCC pavement and shoving in AC pavement. In addition, thermal orthophotos showed potential to detect crack-based distresses. Based on the data analysis, RGB orthophoto resolution of 1.5 millimeters per pixel (mm/pix), DEM resolution of 6 mm/pix, and thermal orthophoto resolution of 30 mm/pix or higher were recommended for airfield pavement distress detection and rating. This research also concluded that sUAS-based PCI inspection not only detects and rates a number of airfield pavement distresses, but also provides PCI values close to the foot-on-ground traditional PCI inspection value. Recommendations on sUAS data collection plan development, safe and efficient data collection, data processing, data analysis, and the process of incorporating sUAS-based PCI inspection to complement traditional PCI inspections are discussed in detail."],

        "mods.abstract":["The generic sector evaluated in this study was based on a four-comer post operation typically used in many terminal areas in the United States. Anival aircraft originated from one of four arrival fixes just outside the sector boundaries. These arrival routes can be thought of as spokes of a wheel with the main airport site as the hub. In addition to the main airport, there were three satellite airports that were under radar control. Departure aircraft from the main and satellite airports were sent directly to one of four departure fixes located outside the sector boundaries. Eleven air traffic controllers from the Atlantic City TRACON participated in the study. The experiment was conducted at the Federal Aviation Administration Technical Center's Human Factors Laboratory at the Atlantic City International Airport, New Jersey. The experimental apparatus consisted of a high fidelity air traffic control simulator with voice communication equipment to allow controllers to issue commands to remote simulation pilots. The results showed significantly lower Air Traffic Workload Input Technique (ATWIT) ratings by the last generic nm compared to the first generic nm on the first-day training nms. Time under control and the distance flown by the aircraft significantly decreased by the last training nm. Controller ratings of workload and stress were also significantly lower by the last generic run. In addition, post-scenario questionnaire ratings for ability to plan, exchange information, and prioritize were significantly higher by the last nm. Correlations between scores on the generic sector and the Atlantic City sector were significant for the over-the-shoulder ratings, ATWIT ratings, and post-scenario questionnaire ratings. Final questionnaire comments indicated that the participants thought the generic sector was representative of a typical terminal environment."],

        "dc.description":["The generic sector evaluated in this study was based on a four-comer post operation typically used in many terminal areas in the United States. Anival aircraft originated from one of four arrival fixes just outside the sector boundaries. These arrival routes can be thought of as spokes of a wheel with the main airport site as the hub. In addition to the main airport, there were three satellite airports that were under radar control. Departure aircraft from the main and satellite airports were sent directly to one of four departure fixes located outside the sector boundaries. Eleven air traffic controllers from the Atlantic City TRACON participated in the study. The experiment was conducted at the Federal Aviation Administration Technical Center's Human Factors Laboratory at the Atlantic City International Airport, New Jersey. The experimental apparatus consisted of a high fidelity air traffic control simulator with voice communication equipment to allow controllers to issue commands to remote simulation pilots. The results showed significantly lower Air Traffic Workload Input Technique (ATWIT) ratings by the last generic nm compared to the first generic nm on the first-day training nms. Time under control and the distance flown by the aircraft significantly decreased by the last training nm. Controller ratings of workload and stress were also significantly lower by the last generic run. In addition, post-scenario questionnaire ratings for ability to plan, exchange information, and prioritize were significantly higher by the last nm. Correlations between scores on the generic sector and the Atlantic City sector were significant for the over-the-shoulder ratings, ATWIT ratings, and post-scenario questionnaire ratings. Final questionnaire comments indicated that the participants thought the generic sector was representative of a typical terminal environment."],

The form is a research-oriented testing and assessment tool designed to measure the efficacy of new air traffic control (ATC) systems, system enhancements, and operational procedures in simulation research. The rating form used in the present study focused on observable behaviors that supervisory air traffic control specialists (SATCSs) use to make behaviorally based ratings of en route controller performance. The present study evaluated the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of performance ratings made by nine Air Route Traffic Control Center supervisors who viewed videotapes and computerized replays of controllers from a previously recorded en route study. The rating form contained 26 items, which were organized into six major categories. Various observable behaviors, which SATCSs identified as those they consider when assessing controller performance, anchored each performance area. Inter-rater (between rater) reliability of SATCS performance ratings assessed using intra-class correlations was somewhat low. Intra-rater (within rater) reliability of SATCS performance ratings was consistent with previous studies and indicated that raters were stable over time in the ratings they assigned. Researchers also investigated the relationship between SATCS performance ratings and personality traits from the Sixteen Personality Factor personality inventory. The results indicated that what SATCSs bring with them to the experimental evaluation setting, in terms of personality traits, may be related to their ratings.

The form is a research-oriented testing and assessment tool designed to measure the efficacy of new air traffic control (ATC) systems, system enhancements, and operational procedures in simulation research. The rating form used in the present study focused on observable behaviors that supervisory air traffic control specialists (SATCSs) use to make behaviorally based ratings of en route controller performance. The present study evaluated the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of performance ratings made by nine Air Route Traffic Control Center supervisors who viewed videotapes and computerized replays of controllers from a previously recorded en route study. The rating form contained 26 items, which were organized into six major categories. Various observable behaviors, which SATCSs identified as those they consider when assessing controller performance, anchored each performance area. Inter-rater (between rater) reliability of SATCS performance ratings assessed using intra-class correlations was somewhat low. Intra-rater (within rater) reliability of SATCS performance ratings was consistent with previous studies and indicated that raters were stable over time in the ratings they assigned. Researchers also investigated the relationship between SATCS performance ratings and personality traits from the Sixteen Personality Factor personality inventory. The results indicated that what SATCSs bring with them to the experimental evaluation setting, in terms of personality traits, may be related to their ratings. Future research efforts should concentrate on distinguishing the sources of measurement error and making whatever changes necessary to produce a reliable controller performance assessment tool."],

The primary objective was to determine whether cameras are beneficial for SNT operations. Background: The SNT concept shifts from relying primarily on the out-the-window view to a model that relies more on using surveillance and cameras. There are different ways to implement the SNT concept. Two alternatives are Supplemental use (in addition to out the window display) and Contingency use (when the out the window view is unavailable). Method: Eight controllers ran traffic in this study with two main conditions, Supplemental and Contingency, with four off-nominal events (aircraft crosses unoccupied runway, aircraft crosses occupied runway, wheels up on approach, aborted takeoff aircraft on runway). Results: The controllers were able to perform their jobs effectively in both Supplemental and Contingency conditions using cameras and surveillance displays. Controllers in conditions with the camera consistently detected the ―wheels up on approach‖ off-nominal condition. Controllers in conditions without the camera did not detect the ―wheels up on approach‖ off-nominal condition at all. The other three off-nominal conditions were detected primarily using the Traffic Information Display System (TIDS) and alerts. The controllers rated the camera as essential in both Supplemental and Contingency conditions, although less for Supplemental than Contingency. Controllers agreed that the SNT concept would be beneficial for the National Airspace System (NAS) and for control tower operations. Conclusion: Results of this study show that controllers can perform their jobs effectively in both Supplemental and Contingency SNT environments and show that cameras provide a benefit to operations. Applications: These findings will directly influence decisions on the SNT concept implementation. Although cameras were found to be beneficial, we will still need to refine the details of camera coverage, display configuration, and control functionality. We believe that small improvements based on controller feedback from this study should lead to enhanced situational awareness for controllers and improved ATC performance."],

The controllers rated the camera as essential in both Supplemental and Contingency conditions, although less for Supplemental than Contingency. Controllers agreed that the SNT concept would be beneficial for the National Airspace System (NAS) and for control tower operations. Conclusion: Results of this study show that controllers can perform their jobs effectively in both Supplemental and Contingency SNT environments and show that cameras provide a benefit to operations. Applications: These findings will directly influence decisions on the SNT concept implementation. Although cameras were found to be beneficial, we will still need to refine the details of camera coverage, display configuration, and control functionality. We believe that small improvements based on controller feedback from this study should lead to enhanced situational awareness for controllers and improved ATC performance."],

Prior to making formal ratings, the observers participated in a training program designed to help them become proficient in observational rating. During the evaluation phase of the study, the observers viewed 20 one-hour videotapes of controllers working different traffic scenarios. The results indicated that most of the rating scales had reasonable inter-rater reliabilities ranging from r = .7 to r = .9.

The results suggest that there are small differences in intelligibility on the different voice switches, and potentially depending on which station is listening.

          "In a joint effort by George Mason University, The Ohio State University, NASA John H. Glenn Research Center, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aircraft Catastrophic Failure Prevention Program, technology is being advanced to produce predictive impact analysis based on a material’s mechanical properties. The team has developed Inconel-718 mechanical property data and the analytical capability that allows for a comprehensive representation of that data in LS-DYNA®, using the *MAT_224 material model. The tabulated input was developed using data from many tests including tension, compression, shear, and many additional stress-states. Both the test data and the modeling also include temperature and strain rate dependencies. This report documents the process of transforming the material test data into a set of *MAT_224 input parameters, including the necessary processing that ensures stable and repeatable results. Verification and validation of the presented models was achieved through comparisons with ballistic impact tests."],

The char, soot, and several other fire by-products often mask relevant aspects of the structural damage morphology, impeding identification of the underlying failure mechanisms of composite materials. In this report, the effects of small-flame direct fire exposure and efficacy of char removal techniques on mechanically failed Cytec T40-800/Cycom® 5215 graphite/epoxy and pristine Hexcel® SGP370-8H/8552 carbon/epoxy specimens were examined. Small-flame vertical and horizontal Bunsen burner fire tests were performed on mechanically failed unnotched compression, short beam strength, and in-plane shear graphite/epoxy specimens. Vertical burn tests were conducted on pristine carbon/epoxy specimens for initial char removal assessment. Both visual inspection and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the fracture surface morphology of the mechanically failed specimens, investigate the induced thermal damage due to fire exposure, and assess the effectiveness of the char removal techniques. The fire damage consisted of matrix decomposition, melt dripping, char and soot deposition, matrix cracking, delamination, and residual thickness increases due to explosive outgassing. The composite thermal degradation due to heat conduction, combustion, and/or thermal deformation was significantly affected by the specimen layup, ply orientation relative to the heat source, and the fracture surface morphology. Char removal approaches, including ultrasonication, chemical solvent soaking, liquid nitrogen dipping, and a combination of thermal cycling and ultrasonication, were explored, resulting in partial char removal. This research is intended to be related work to the Composite Failure Analysis Handbook, DOT/FAA/AR-91/23 | WL-TI-91-4032 published through a joint research effort by the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB and the FAA. It should be noted these tests were conducted using a small methane flame, rather than a large pool fire, and therefore conclusions pertaining to aircraft accidents involving fire may not be directly applicable. The next phase for this project will address the fuel type and flame intensity to more accurately represent realistic accident conditions."],

The goal is to learn about how controllers use information displays and develop techniques for reducing air traffic-related errors. This report describes a research project conducted at the Research Development and Human Factors Laboratory of the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center. Volunteer controllers participated in a real-time, air traffic control simulation of airspace modeled after their Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility. ATCSs worked two different levels of simulated traffic. Some scenarios contained incursions into their Class C airspace, and overflights provided visual noise. Results indicated that the ATCSs’ workload increased with higher traffic loads. However, visual noise had more impact on their perceived workload when things were slower and not when they were already busy. An eye tracker recorded eye movements. The visual scanning data included fixations, saccades, blinks, and pupil information. Increased traffic loads decreased the number of fixations on the radarscope. The increase in task load seemed to divert the ATCSs’ attention to areas other than the scope, most specifically the keyboard, suggesting they were spending more time updating flight plans and less time scanning the scope. Controllers developed scanning patterns that focused on the areas of highest traffic density. This may be why they identified airspace intrusions late or not at all in some specific cases. Such lapses suggest that intrusion targets must be emphasized with color, blinking, or some other means to draw the controllers attention from established patterns. This may increase airspace safety.

A lift-plus-cruise (LPC) aircraft flight simulation model was deployed to two flight simulators, with identical cockpit display elements and core flight control system (FCS) architecture, which was based on the Total Energy Control System (TECS). The simulator setups differed in the design of the pilot inceptors and in the inceptor-to-command mappings."],

These flight test maneuvers, when executed by at least three test pilot evaluators, provide assigned levels of handling qualities using the well-established Cooper-Harper Handling Qualities Rating Scale. Later, a comprehensive flight test guide was created to layout the procedures and test methods needed to generate the required data to evaluate a given design against the quantitative requirements included in the design standard. Building upon this approach, selected FTMs/MTEs will be used along with other supporting data as means of compliance (MOC) towards civilian type certification of the powered lift configurations designed for the emerging advanced air mobility (AAM) market."],

Four commonly used disinfection methods were identified and utilized to condition the test articles: fogging, electrostatic spraying, wiping, and UV-C disinfecting. After conditioning was complete, the test articles were evaluated for changes in their tensile strength, flammability properties, physical properties, and material properties. It was determined that all of the chemical disinfectants evaluated caused changes in at least one material property in the plastic and coating coupons tested in this study. Likewise, LRUs also experienced changes from each chemical disinfectant.

There are many problems to be solved and safety standards and precautions established if aircrafts are going to be equipped with hydrogen. To that end, the objective of this project is to understand the fundamental characteristics of hydrogen flames. More specifically, small hydrogen flames resulting from leaks in diameter of less than 2mm will be studied and their flame characteristics recorded. To simulate leak conditions, a small-scale, horizontal custom hydrogen burner was made with five interchangeable nozzles, each representing a different leak. The nozzles varied in shape between circular and slot orifices, varied in size under 2mm, and the standard leakage flow rate varied was between 1SLPM (Standard Liters Per Minute) and 5SLPM. Nozzle exit-sensor spacing was an additional parameter which was varied between 1in (25mm), 2in (50mm), and 4in (100mm). A water-cooled gardon gauge was utilized to record impinging flame heat flux and K-type thermocouples were used to record cross-sectional flame temperature. Additionally, a flame tracking software was used to estimate the horizontal flame length from the nozzle exit up to the furthest horizontal reach of the flame. Results show that the most influential parameters for leakage flames are the leak size and the flow rate of hydrogen, while the leak shape (whether a crack or a pore) has little influence on the flame characteristics. Generally, increasing standard flow rate (SFR) of hydrogen while keeping leak size constant resulted in an increase in flame heat flux and flame temperature, while increasing the leak size for a given flow resulted in a decrease in flame heat flux and flame temperature.

        "mods.abstract":["In fiscal year (FY) 2012, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Office of Airports (ARP) initiated a research study to identify and geographically locate areas at airports with nonstandard taxiway geometry. This research was advanced because an earlier study (Legarreta, 2012) had shown nonstandard taxiway geometries to be associated with a higher prevalence of runway incursions. The FAA defines a runway incursion (RI) as “any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an aircraft, vehicle, or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and takeoff of aircraft” (FAA, 2015). These occurrences include wrong runway landings and takeoffs. This research effort developed a geographic information system (GIS) database of approximately 520 airports with civilian air traffic control towers. For each airport, the location of nonstandard geometries, runway incursions, airfield hotspot areas, airport diagrams, and other airport-related information is identified. This research study identified 140 airfield locations with high incidences of RIs using data from October 1, 2007, to September 30, 2013. As a result, a 15- to 20-year improvement program, known as the Runway Incursion Mitigation (RIM) program, launched in FY2015. The goal of the program was to mitigate airfield locations with high incidences of RIs. A subset of the 140 locations identified was then validated for inclusion in the RIM program and prioritized for mitigation. The RIM program is updated annually using the GIS airport database to identify construction-related changes to airfield layout and their impacts on taxiway geometries, the airfield location of new RIs, and the status of airfield locations prioritized for mitigation. This report summarizes the status of the RIM program through FY2023. In 2023, the program georeferenced 1,330 RIs; added 62 nonstandard geometry locations; prioritized 16 locations for mitigation; and identified 13 locations as mitigated. Since the program’s initiation, 16,521 RIs have been georeferenced at airports along with more than 6,695 nonstandard geometry locations. In addition, 230 airfield locations were prioritized for mitigation, and 100 of these locations have been mitigated. For mitigated locations and incursion data through calendar year 2022, the incursion rate has been reduced by 69 percent."],

An increase in automation shifted the focus of the data controller from the radar display to the DST, whereas, an increase in traffic shifted the focus more to the radar display. With an increase in traffic or a decrease in automation, the trust in automation decreased.

Background: The ATWIT is a measure of workload that was originally a 10-point scale, but subsequent research includes a 7-point variation of this scale. Scale size is known to impact assessment reliability, and more reliable scales produce stronger effect sizes and reduce costs that are associated with experimentation. Therefore, it is important to know whether the 7-point or 10-point version of the scale is more reliable. Method: The authors conducted a preliminary meta-analysis of 15 studies. The analysis examined correlations between ratings using the ATWIT and aircraft count (an objective measure of difficulty) to compare effect sizes across studies with a 7-point scale and a 10-point scale. Results: Findings indicated that the strength of the correlation between ATWIT ratings and aircraft count was greater for the 10-point version of the ATWIT than for the 7-point version. Conclusion: The 10-point scale appears to be more appropriate for the ATWIT than the 7-point scale. The authors recommend that researchers use a 10-point for the ATWIT, unless they have clear justification for deviating from this convention.

        "mods.abstract":["Objective: The En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) system will continue to integrate new capabilities and features to assist controllers in managing increasingly high levels of traffic in the National Airspace System (NAS). The Federal Aviation Administration Human Factors Branch conducted a study to examine potential modifications to the system. The study included an evaluation of (a) the location and format of conflict probe notifications, (b) the use of 30-inch displays, and (c) the use of different pointing devices at en route controller workstations. This report summarizes the evaluations of the conflict probe and display alternatives. Background: This is the second Separation Management simulation. The first simulation investigated the automation requirements needed to assist controllers in working en route sectors capable of accommodating 3-nmi (5.56 km) and 5-nmi (9.26 km) separation standards. Method: Eighteen (12 retired, 6 current) en route air traffic controllers participated in the study. All participants managed high-traffic level scenarios under test conditions that varied the location and format of the conflict probe notifications on controller displays and that compared controller management of traffic using current displays and 30-inch displays. We collected system and participant performance measures and ratings of workload and performance. Results: We did not find significant differences across test conditions for measures of performance, efficiency, and safety. We did find that radar (R)-side participants viewed a higher proportion of notifications when only the most imminent notifications were presented on their displays. When notifications were available on the R-side display, the participants tended to select them more often from the data block than from the Conflict Alert List. In the Display Evaluation, the 30-inch displays were rated more favorably by the data (D)-side participants than by the R-side participants. Conclusion: Providing conflict probe notifications for imminent notifications on the R-side display and providing a 30-inch display on the D-side appear useful."],

        "dc.description":["Objective: The En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) system will continue to integrate new capabilities and features to assist controllers in managing increasingly high levels of traffic in the National Airspace System (NAS). The Federal Aviation Administration Human Factors Branch conducted a study to examine potential modifications to the system. The study included an evaluation of (a) the location and format of conflict probe notifications, (b) the use of 30-inch displays, and (c) the use of different pointing devices at en route controller workstations. This report summarizes the evaluations of the conflict probe and display alternatives. Background: This is the second Separation Management simulation. The first simulation investigated the automation requirements needed to assist controllers in working en route sectors capable of accommodating 3-nmi (5.56 km) and 5-nmi (9.26 km) separation standards. Method: Eighteen (12 retired, 6 current) en route air traffic controllers participated in the study. All participants managed high-traffic level scenarios under test conditions that varied the location and format of the conflict probe notifications on controller displays and that compared controller management of traffic using current displays and 30-inch displays. We collected system and participant performance measures and ratings of workload and performance. Results: We did not find significant differences across test conditions for measures of performance, efficiency, and safety. We did find that radar (R)-side participants viewed a higher proportion of notifications when only the most imminent notifications were presented on their displays. When notifications were available on the R-side display, the participants tended to select them more often from the data block than from the Conflict Alert List. In the Display Evaluation, the 30-inch displays were rated more favorably by the data (D)-side participants than by the R-side participants.

Using an analysis framework outlined by Ahlstrom (2004), we assessed how controllers use weather information during operations to highlight instances where information is missing or inadequately disseminated. To obtain feedback from the field, we conducted a survey where en route Front Line Managers (a) rated the impact on controller operations from different weather phenomena, (b) rated the frequency of use of weather information, and (c)provided suggestions for the development of future weather displays. Our review shows that en route controllers have access to a variety of weather information sources during operations. However, our review also suggests that en route controllers do not have an accurate or timely weather display for precipitation areas at their workstation. We discuss possible enhancements for future weather displays, recommend enhancements to controller precipitation displays, and suggest further research to evaluate enhancements for the dissemination of weather advisories to pilots."],

Using an analysis framework outlined by Ahlstrom (2004), we assessed how controllers use weather information during operations to highlight instances where information is missing or inadequately disseminated. To obtain feedback from the field, we conducted a survey where en route Front Line Managers (a) rated the impact on controller operations from different weather phenomena, (b) rated the frequency of use of weather information, and (c)provided suggestions for the development of future weather displays. Our review shows that en route controllers have access to a variety of weather information sources during operations. However, our review also suggests that en route controllers do not have an accurate or timely weather display for precipitation areas at their workstation. We discuss possible enhancements for future weather displays, recommend enhancements to controller precipitation displays, and suggest further research to evaluate enhancements for the dissemination of weather advisories to pilots."],

The purpose of this study is to research the benefits of ERIDS to controllers in terms of service efficiency and to the FAA in terms of potential cost savings of personnel labor. We visited the Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) where ERIDS is deployed and the Houston ARTCC where controllers are using paper reference manuals. We observed controllers during live operations, conducted a simulation to collect access times to ATC information, administered a questionnaire, obtained quarterly reports of ERIDS usage, and interviewed staff personnel who support both systems. Thirty-seven supervisors and traffic management coordinators participated in the simulation and provided questionnaire responses. In simulation, participants were generally not faster to access information using ERIDS compared to paper reference manuals. However, our simulation was limited in that all paper reference manuals were within reach of participants. In actual operations, ERIDS can be quickly accessed, whereas, it can take several minutes to find paper reference manuals. Interviews indicated that ERIDS can reduce the labor spent on disseminating paper reference materials."],

The purpose of this study is to research the benefits of ERIDS to controllers in terms of service efficiency and to the FAA in terms of potential cost savings of personnel labor. We visited the Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) where ERIDS is deployed and the Houston ARTCC where controllers are using paper reference manuals. We observed controllers during live operations, conducted a simulation to collect access times to ATC information, administered a questionnaire, obtained quarterly reports of ERIDS usage, and interviewed staff personnel who support both systems. Thirty-seven supervisors and traffic management coordinators participated in the simulation and provided questionnaire responses. In simulation, participants were generally not faster to access information using ERIDS compared to paper reference manuals. However, our simulation was limited in that all paper reference manuals were within reach of participants. In actual operations, ERIDS can be quickly accessed, whereas, it can take several minutes to find paper reference manuals. Interviews indicated that ERIDS can reduce the labor spent on disseminating paper reference materials."],

As deployment expands nationwide, several facilities may eventually receive all three tools. Before this occurs, it is important to identify any potential human factors issues that may arise due to the collocation of these tools at the controller’s workstation. In this report, we present the first of three high fidelity human-in-the-loop simulation experiments we conducted to evaluate the impact of URET, TMA, and CPDLC collocation on controller workload, situational awareness, and teamwork. We examined collocation issues with a “stovepipe” independent configuration where none of the tools were integrated or directly communicated with each other. In this first experiment, twelve Air Traffic Control Specialists (ATCSs) participated as Rside/ D-side controller teams operating a high altitude generic sector using all combinations of the three tools. The most important collocation issue identified was that controllers had difficulty accessing important information on the D-side display when URET and CPDLC were both operational (i.e., display clutter). Although neither tool alone caused display clutter, both tools in combination made it difficult for D-side controllers to find the information they needed quickly. This was especially true for accessing CPDLC windows, which became covered when controllers used URET. Another collocation issue was that D-side controllers had to access TMA delay time information from the R-side display. Controllers thought it was important to have TMA information available on the D-side display where it could be easily accessed by D-side controllers. However, controllers were concerned that simply showing the TMA List on the D-side might add to the D-side display clutter. Good human factors design principles prescribe that users must have immediate access to important information and that critical information should never be covered. A “stovepipe” independent deployment of these tools will result in impaired access to timely information. The results of this study indicated that better efforts should be made towards integrating the information from URET, TMA, and CPDLC on the D-side monitor prior to deployment."],

These efforts have taken many forms and have focused on both the ground and air sides of the airspace system. Psychologists, engineers, systems analysists, computer scientists, and others have participated in the studies that have led to the numerous reports and papers cited in the bibliography. While this listing is probably not all inclusive, it covers virtually all work that is referenced in automated data bases plus publications that were identified by current and past researchers, but which never made it to the computerized listings. This bibliography is meant to highlight the work that has gone on over the years. While many of the documents cited are still available from the Technical Center library, or from the authors themselves, the editors do not suggest that everything is retrievable, and, in fact, much of the older work has been superseded by more modern technology and thinking. The research of 30 years ago has served as a foundation for the human factors engineering that is being done today. The references are provided in alphabetical order and indexed by numbers associated with subject matter categories. Human factors research is alive and continues to progress in the FAA and at the Technical Center."],

Potential benefits of introducing these procedures include: 1) more fuel efficient and time saving routings 2) reduced dependence on radar vectoring, altitude and speed assignments that contribute to frequency congestion 3) more efficient use of inherently limited terminal airspace. As operational implementation of RNAV procedures began, analysis of occasional failures to comply with RNAV Standard Instrument Departure (SID) clearances focused attention on a number of issues. This study focused on issues involving Air Traffic Control (ATC) phraseology used for issuing clearances to join a departure route and for returning aircraft to SIDs, after issuing an altitude, speed, and/or heading change. In these cases, ATC may not have effectively communicated the intent of the issued instruction. The Pilot/Controller Phraseology and Procedures Action Team (P/CPP AT), under the Departure and Landing Workgroup of the Performance Based Operational Aviation Rulemaking Committee (PARC), addresses such pilot/controller procedure and phraseology issues. The P/CPP AT sponsored this study. They identified an operational need to establish Climb Via procedures and phraseology for SIDs, similar to the \"descend via\" procedures and phraseology currently in use for Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR’s). Accordingly, the P/CPP AT drafted new procedures and phraseology for addition to FAA Order 7110.65, describing the Climb Via instructions.

ATCSs either worked as a radar controller, a radar associate with additional multi-sector responsibilities, or as a multi-sector airspace coordinator. Our visual scanning results show that the Experimental Position in either the radar or Airspace Coordinator position predominantly used the radar display to obtain control information. In contrast, the Upstream Radar Associates obtained control information from the radar display, Data (D)-side computer readout device, and Flight Progress Strips. As an Upstream D-side, ATCSs spent more time transitioning between scene planes and were able to pick up less information because of this. As an Upstream D-side, the Experimental ATCSs’ mean fixation durations were lower, implying that they spent more time reading the other displays. As radar controllers, participants devoted more mental resources to search for potential aircraft conflicts than when acting as airspace coordinators. As Airspace Coordinators, they devoted more mental resources to search for direct routes. This finding reflects the differences between tactical and strategic control responsibilities. Overall, ATCSs were more favorable of the Airspace Coordinator who coordinated control actions through Radar-side ATCSs compared to a multi-sector planner who would directly communicate control actions to aircraft. They felt that an Airspace Coordinator would improve safety, increase efficiency, evenly distribute workload, and be more helpful and less interfering. Further, the Experimental ATCSs rated the direct routing advisory automation functions as important for an Airspace Coordinator as a conflict probe or conflict resolution function. We found that a strategic multi-sector position can be introduced into the current Display System Replacement environment. The Airspace Coordinator’s roles and responsibilities has an advantage over the Upstream Radar Associate’s roles and responsibilities because the Radar Associate tended to revert to more tactical control responsibilities, particularly under high task loads.

This report provides a human factors analysis of ATC alerts and recommends changes to the alert algorithms and presentation that should increase controller effectiveness and overall system safety. We collected automation data from en route, approach control, and tower facilities that show how often alerts occur, how controllers respond to alerts, and when controller actions occur relative to the alerts. Of all the alerts examined, the majority received no response from controllers; many were so brief that controllers must have resolved the situation prior to the activation or the alert situation resolved itself without action by the controller. Of the alert situations where actions were taken, controllers most often took action before the alert activated. The results suggest that (a) many alerts are valid according to the alert algorithms but do not provide useful information to controllers, (b) these “nuisance alerts” are extremely common in the field, and (c) high nuisance alert rates may desensitize controllers and lead to poor performance. We recommend that the Federal Aviation Administration address the problem of nuisance alerts by improving safety alert algorithms, improving alert presentations, and providing better alert suppression functions. To improve safety alert algorithms, we recommend using data from this study to obtain better measures of critical reaction time parameters for alert algorithms. To reduce the impact of nuisance alerts, we recommend using alert presentations with multiple levels of urgency."],

        "dc.description":["Controllers receive several types of alerts from Air Traffic Control (ATC) automation systems that warn of potentially hazardous situations, including Conflict Alerts, Mode-C Intruder alerts, and Minimum Safe Altitude Warnings. This report provides a human factors analysis of ATC alerts and recommends changes to the alert algorithms and presentation that should increase controller effectiveness and overall system safety. We collected automation data from en route, approach control, and tower facilities that show how often alerts occur, how controllers respond to alerts, and when controller actions occur relative to the alerts. Of all the alerts examined, the majority received no response from controllers; many were so brief that controllers must have resolved the situation prior to the activation or the alert situation resolved itself without action by the controller. Of the alert situations where actions were taken, controllers most often took action before the alert activated. The results suggest that (a) many alerts are valid according to the alert algorithms but do not provide useful information to controllers, (b) these “nuisance alerts” are extremely common in the field, and (c) high nuisance alert rates may desensitize controllers and lead to poor performance. We recommend that the Federal Aviation Administration address the problem of nuisance alerts by improving safety alert algorithms, improving alert presentations, and providing better alert suppression functions. To improve safety alert algorithms, we recommend using data from this study to obtain better measures of critical reaction time parameters for alert algorithms. To reduce the impact of nuisance alerts, we recommend using alert presentations with multiple levels of urgency."],

The study employed a critical tracking task, in which 24 subjects (pilots and nonpilots) viewed an analog display of the error between operator input and system output while correcting with opposite pressure on a joystick. The purpose was to determine if there was a relationship between participant responses on a 10-point scale administered during task performance and tracking task difficulty. It is generally concluded that POSWAT used for measuring effort rating and rating delay on a regular basis during this experiment is minimally intrusive, is informative, and merits further evaluation in a cockpit environment."],

This report describes the second high fidelity, human-in-the-loop simulation study of VDL3 system performance and operational acceptability. The first study evaluated VDL3 with air traffic controllers. We conducted the current study to validate the findings of the first study with pilots, to compare analog communications to those using VDL3, and to assess analog and VDL3 communications under routine conditions and under adverse weather conditions that further increased demand for the channel. Fourteen airline pilots participated in the study using two realistic flight deck simulators. VDL3 allowed more successful transmissions to be made. Most other communications characteristics did not differ between the radio systems. The effects of adverse weather were similar for both systems. The participants were highly positive in their evaluations of VDL3. They rated the operational acceptability of VDL3 higher than analog, and they nearly always rated the digital system as equal to or better than analog for completing communication tasks. Overall, the results indicate that VDL3 is an acceptable communications system for pilots."],

Background: The Conflict Probe can exhibit very high or very low accuracy depending on the analysis technique. It is necessary to establish both an empirically backed criterion for accuracy and the appropriate accuracy analyses and metrics. Method: A meta-analysis was conducted on Human Factors automation reliability literature; an additional analysis was done on the results of probe reliability studies by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Concept Analysis branch to derive various accuracy metrics. The results were compared to determine the acceptability of the conflict probe accuracy. Results: The meta-analysis produced an estimated criterion of 65% correct responses for automation to improve performance, but this estimate is subject to a broad confidence interval due to variability in the source data from the literature. The probe performance exceeded the 65% value when giving credit for all correct rejections, but it fell short when not giving credit for correct rejections. Another metric, Positive Predictive Value (PPV, the percent of alerts that are valid), is operationally meaningful and its values demonstrated large accuracy improvements over baseline with the FAA Concept Analysis’ parametric adjustments, but a PPV cutoff criterion could not be established from the meta-analysis. Conclusion: The present results provide insight on several fronts, but operational input is essential to determine (1) a more justifiable air traffic control-specific accuracy criterion and (2) which aircraft encounters are appropriate to include in a test set for accuracy assessment. Automation responses should only increase the value of an accuracy metric to the extent that the responses add informational value for the controller. Applications: The present results will be used in the design of an evaluation to derive a set of operationally meaningful aircraft encounters. Different measures of accuracy, such as PPV, also merit further exploration."],

The literature indicates that pilot use of a basic CDTI to assist in visually acquiring traffic and following a lead aircraft is beneficial, and that pilot workload is generally acceptable. Controller reaction to pilot use of the CDTI for these purposes has also been generally positive. More advanced concepts that involve the use of more sophisticated CDTI functions require modifications to current procedures and additional controller workstation tools. The results from most studies indicate that the advanced concepts require further development before they become operationally feasible. 17."],

Using data from a high-fidelity human-in-the-loop weather simulation, we explored eye activity measures like pupil diameter, blink duration, and saccade distance, and assessed their relationship to subjective workload ratings. In our initial analysis, we established that although there was no significant effect of weather tool use on subjective workload ratings, there was a significant relationship between subjective workload ratings and our task load variable aircraft density. We found a linear increase in workload ratings with an increasing number of aircraft in the sector. In a subsequent analysis, we assessed the relationship between eye movement activity measures and aircraft density. We found that the mean blink duration and the mean saccade distance decreased as aircraft density increased, while the mean pupil diameter increased with an increasing number of aircraft in the sector. After establishing the relationship between these eye activity metrics and subjective workload, we evaluated whether we could use changes in eye movement activity along with other system state variables, like distance to weather from the outer marker, to measure ongoing controller workload. We developed both individual controller models and a general model (across controllers) to assess whether it was possible to predict the minute-by-minute number of aircraft in the sector. Using both multiple regression modeling and neural network models, we were able to produce individual controller models and general models with good prediction performances.

Background: The current en route trackball is inherently limited as to what kind of interactions it allows. However, switching to a new pointing device has risks—different pointing devices have different speed, accuracy, interaction capabilities, and ergonomic features. Method: Ten current or recently retired en route Certified Professional Controllers participated in the simulation.

During the simulations, we recorded the participants’ subjective reports, performance, behavior, and muscle activity. Results: We found that participants preferred the mouse and current trackball over all other devices and were as successful controlling traffic (e.g., no losses of separation with the same number of aircraft under active control). We found no statistically significant physiological indications that any of the devices under evaluation had the potential to result in musculoskeletal disorders during regular use. We also found that participants were more accurate and significantly faster using the mouse than using other devices.

Background: Tower controllers in proposed SNT environments will use certified surveillance and camera views instead of the out-the-window view while providing Air Traffic Control services. As the use of cameras for this purpose is a new concept, there are many different ways this concept could be implemented. This study examined some of the alternatives for implementing the SNT concept in a realistic environment. Method: In this study, four NextGen Air Traffic Control Management Cadre members controlled traffic and evaluated camera use during nine 15-minute, low-level traffic scenarios that included off-nominal events. At the end of each scenario and at the end of the study, the participants completed a questionnaire, suggested improvements, and provided comments on adequacy, necessity, and usability of the cameras and displays. Results: The participants suggested making several changes to the camera system prior to future studies. These suggestions included changing the camera placement, increasing the camera resolution, and providing independent cameras for each control position. The participants identified viewing aircraft on final approach and holding short of runways as potential applications for cameras in an SNT environment. Participants also identified the need for some type of alerting decision-support tool. Conclusion: Participants provided specific feedback that can lead to changes in the way the SNT concept is implemented. Applications: Suggested improvements from this study will be incorporated into a future SNT human-in-the-loop simulation and into field demonstrations.

          "This document presents a general methodology for developing Airway Facilities (AF) symbols and provides guidelines for the coding of visual symbols and auditory signals. Coding refers to the characteristics of a symbol that developers can change to improve its interpretation or message content. These coding guidelines should not be considered exhaustive but rather represent a compilation of the most important items to consider when developing visual or auditory symbols. The decision to use a visual symbol, an auditory signal, or both, will depend on the nature of the displayed information, operational conditions, and users requirements. A list of questions for determining the best coding technique is provided. AF symbols represent facilities, equipment, services, and status information such as alarms and alerts. These guidelines also I provide a systematic methodology for developing symbols that will help in the creation and testing of effective symbols."],

Background: To support the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) program, ongoing efforts focus on the implementation and use of weather technologies and weather presentations. Method: Sixty instrument-rated GA pilots volunteered to participate in the study. We manipulated the independent variable Weather Presentations by presenting weather information under three different symbology modes. In Experiment 1, we assess pilot perception of METAR symbols during flight and assess how this affects flight behavior, cognitive engagement, and decision-making. In Experiment 2, we focus on pilot perception of time-stamps and weather symbols in a \"change-detection\" experiment. Results: The result shows that pilots (using different weather presentations) vary considerably in their overall perception of METAR symbol change during flight. The overall group detection ranges from a virtual blindness (25% detections) to a modest detection performance (62% detections). The result from the change-detection experiment shows that the detection accuracy varies greatly between different weather symbols and between different weather presentations. Although the average change-detection performance is high across all weather presentations for precipitation areas (on average, 89% to 94% correct detections), SIGMET areas (83% to 93%), and METAR symbols (83% to 91%), pilots are virtually blind to changes for lightning symbols (17% to 43%) and time-stamp information (13% to 20%). Conclusion: Weather presentation symbology affects pilots’ perception of symbol change and cognitive engagement. Pilot performance varies credibly between different symbology renderings of the same weather data. Applications: This simulation is part of an ongoing assessment of the effects of weather-presentation symbology related to the optimization of weather presentations in cockpits."],

All ratings were consensus ratings (group ratings) that followed a detailed and complete discussion of each topic. For controller operations, the group provided the highest impact ratings for thunderstorms, snow and ice, and airport reconfiguration due to changing winds. For pilot operations, The group provided the highest impact ratings for thunderstorms, wind shear, microbursts, snow and ice, and mountain wave. The present analysis reveals several information needs for the TRACON controller. Specifically, there is a lack of a graphical display of weather areas with short-time forecast capabilities at the controller workstation. For non-convective turbulence and adverse winds, there is a shortfall in the accuracy of available tools."],

The data consisted of eye movement recordings from time intervals when controllers activated a static or a dynamic Storm Motion tool. Both of these tools provided information about the direction of storm cell motion and future extrapolated positions of the storm cell leading edge. By analyzing the location and extent of fixations, we performed an assessment to identify the static weather tool features that captured controllers’ visual attention (i.e., areas of visual interest). Second, we analyzed controller scan path behavior (a series of fixations and saccades) while they were using the static and the dynamic tools. Third, we assessed controller fixation prioritization strategies during static tool usage. Our analysis revealed that controllers focused their visual attention significantly more on the area between the storm cell leading edge and the 10 minute extrapolated position compared to other areas of the static Storm Motion tool. With regards to controller scan paths, we found that dynamic Storm Motion tools significantly reduced controller scan path areas, scan path distances, and scan path durations compared to the static tool. Furthermore, the mean pupil diameter was significantly larger for controllers while using the static tool compared to the dynamic tool, indicating a higher visual and cognitive workload during this display condition. We found little evidence for systematic controller fixation behavior while they were using the static tool. The few systematic patterns that we revealed were two-step fixation patterns (e.g., aircraft ? 10 minute extrapolated position), and the vast majority of fixation orders (patterns) were unique to each individual controller. Evidently, the static Storm Motion tool provided weak affordances to controllers during tactical operations.

On the initial quick scan, the dog was correct on 11 out of the 15 boxes, with more accurate results on lithium-ion batteries than lithium metal. On a second more thorough inspection, the canine was 100% accurate on all the boxes. The effectiveness of this dog in detecting lithium batteries shows that this could potentially be a reasonably accurate and practical method for future detection of non-compliant lithium battery shipments on passenger and cargo aircraft."],

Fifteen identical cardboard boxes that either contained different types of lithium batteries, or were empty, were spread out around a building for the canine to inspect. On the initial quick scan, the dog was correct on 11 out of the 15 boxes, with more accurate results on lithium-ion batteries than lithium metal. On a second more thorough inspection, the canine was 100% accurate on all the boxes. The effectiveness of this dog in detecting lithium batteries shows that this could potentially be a reasonably accurate and practical method for future detection of non-compliant lithium battery shipments on passenger and cargo aircraft."],

This report details mechanical testing of the plastic deformation and rupture of precipitate hardened Inconel 718. Specimens were tested in tension, compression, and shear under a wide range of strain rates from 10-4 s-1 to 5000 s-1 and temperatures from 23 °C to 800 °C. Experiments were conducted on five different plate stocks of thickness 1.27 mm, 2.03 mm, 3.17 mm, 6.35 mm, and 12.7 mm. Specimens were cut in different orientations to examine the directional dependence of the material. Dynamic tests were conducted using split Hopkinson bars. Full field strain measurements were made using digital image correlation (DIC) techniques. Ductile fracture was also examined for different stress states induced by subjecting various specimen geometries to different loading conditions. Fracture tests included tension experiments on notched plane stress, plane strain, and axisymmetric specimens as well as combined loading tension-torsion and compression-torsion experiments of tubular specimens and punch tests on flat specimens. The material test plan, experimental setups and procedures, specimen designs, and results are presented and discussed in detail. The Inconel 718 tested exhibits significant strain hardening and strain rate sensitivity as well as a general decrease in strength with increasing temperature."],

          "A team consisting of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Propulsion Research Program, The Ohio State University (OSU), George Mason University (GMU), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Glenn Research Center (NASA-GRC) collaborated to develop a new material model in LS-DYNA for impact applications of Inconel 718, a nickel based superalloy used widely for turbine engine hot section blades, disks, cases, and other components. This report details mechanical testing of the plastic deformation and rupture of precipitate hardened Inconel 718. Specimens were tested in tension, compression, and shear under a wide range of strain rates from 10-4 s-1 to 5000 s-1 and temperatures from 23 °C to 800 °C. Experiments were conducted on five different plate stocks of thickness 1.27 mm, 2.03 mm, 3.17 mm, 6.35 mm, and 12.7 mm. Specimens were cut in different orientations to examine the directional dependence of the material. Dynamic tests were conducted using split Hopkinson bars. Full field strain measurements were made using digital image correlation (DIC) techniques. Ductile fracture was also examined for different stress states induced by subjecting various specimen geometries to different loading conditions. Fracture tests included tension experiments on notched plane stress, plane strain, and axisymmetric specimens as well as combined loading tension-torsion and compression-torsion experiments of tubular specimens and punch tests on flat specimens. The material test plan, experimental setups and procedures, specimen designs, and results are presented and discussed in detail. The Inconel 718 tested exhibits significant strain hardening and strain rate sensitivity as well as a general decrease in strength with increasing temperature."],

Many of the COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at extremely low temperatures to maintain efficacy, therefore, dry ice has been used as a method to keep vaccines refrigerated throughout air shipments. Dry ice is categorized as a Class 9 (Miscellaneous) Dangerous Good. Dry ice undergoes a process called sublimation at normal pressure and temperatures, in which the solidified form transitions directly to gaseous CO2. This process can create an oxygen deficient environment in confined areas (including aircraft), which can produce shortness of breath, unconsciousness, or death if exposed over prolonged periods of time. An assessment was conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to identify parameters pertinent to dry ice sublimation throughout air shipment. This study was motivated by minor sublimation rates (<1% per hour) claimed from container manufacturers. This has important safety implications as decreases in sublimation rates allow for exponential increases in permitted dry ice cargo. Further analysis was needed. Specifically, this study evaluated the following parameters’ impact: temperature, pressure, humidity, dry ice pellet size, container design and durability. Results indicate that dry ice pellet size, container design, and durability had a clear impact on sublimation rate. Sublimation rates differed significantly between the three containers evaluated within this study and were observed to increase as containers were reused. Furthermore, dry ice pellets with smaller nominal diameters were noted to sublimate at a higher rate than those with a larger diameter. Other evaluated parameters within this study produced no clear correlation. Although sublimation was observed to be affected by numerous parameters, data suggests a conservative approach to this subject is prudent. While some external conditions may produce only minor differences in sublimation rates, it would have a major impact on the allowable quantity of dry ice shipped."],

Impact tests have revealed that mode of failure on metal superalloys thick plate at high-speed impact is what is known as Adiabatic shear band (ASB). The tabulated J-C material model is the current state of the art for FEM of high velocity impacts. The development of the tabulated J-C material model started from the consideration that materials under impact are affected by large deformations, high strain rates, temperature softening, and varying stress-states and that the failure is also changing as a function of the state of stress. Validated numerical 2D simulations revealed that the current J-C material model is successful in predicting this mode of failure only under the condition of using meshes composed of elements with a size that is of the same magnitude order of the ASB width. Because the ASB width of some high-performance metal alloys is in the order of 1μm, the material model cannot be use in practical real application to predict ASB. This thesis describes the upgrades implemented in the current Finite Element Model (FEM) of tabulated Johnson Cook (J-C) material model that allow the development of Adiabatic Shear Bands (ASBs) under the correct loading conditions in meshes with element size of practical use in current engineering applications. Ductile deformation and failure mechanism of Inconel 718 superalloy were investigated experimentally and numerically for quasi-static and dynamic conditions at various temperatures and stress states. Impact tests were used to derive high strain rate strain-stress characteristics, proven to be vital to correctly simulate ASBs, using hybrid explicit-implicit simulations. Tabulated inputs of characterized material tests results were directly used to describe both the constitutive and failure characteristics of the material model. Full scale impact tests were used to validate and show robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the modified material model. It is shown that the modified J-C material model can predict ballistic limit and failure modes accurately for structures under impact, modeled with meshes composed of element of size compatible with modern commonly available computational resources even when the failure mode is ASB. The presented material model can be implemented into most available Finite Element software.

It consists of applying an impulse load to simulate a moving wheel and measuring pavement surface deflections. Pavement variables, such as moduli, are determined through backcalculation, which involves a forward model and optimization. The FAA currently employs static analysis in the BAKFAA software but encounters limitations, particularly with thick and stiff airfield pavements. To address these challenges, a dynamic finite element (FE) model was developed under this study that incorporates subgrade damping to improve the reliability of backcalculation. The dynamic FE model was incorporated in a new tool called PULSE_FE to accelerate the computational runtime and improve efficiency. Dynamic backcalculation has been successfully applied to a Construction Cycle-9 flexible test item, and a parametric study has identified key FWD parameters for dynamic backcalculation.

Results from this second phase effort verified the test-fixture loading, validated analysis models, and provided an initial baseline for Nondestructive inspection (NDI) and other monitoring systems to detect damage. For the unnotched panel, structural integrity was maintained through testing with no signs of damage in the test section. Measured strains in the test section were relatively constant and remained unchanged during fatigue. For the open-hole panel strain surveys revealed excellent correlation between test and analysis.

        "mods.abstract":["This report summarizes the current state of understanding related to cold dwell fatigue (CDF) of titanium alloys, which is a failure mechanism that can lead to uncontained failure of rotating components. Jet engine manufacturers have brought forward their collective field and spin rig experience related to CDF and coupled it with a thorough literature review to offer an aviation industry perspective on this critical safety issue. Numerous factors are known to influence susceptibility to CDF including intrinsic factors like alloy composition, microstructure, and residual stress as well as extrinsic factors like applied stress, dwell time, and temperature. Of particular importance is the presence of microtextured regions (MTRs) present in the material. Definitions and best practices for characterizing this microstructural feature are proposed. The mechanisms of damage accumulation, early crack nucleation, and rapid crack propagation through MTRs during CDF are reviewed along with additional effects of microtexture on material properties including conventional fatigue, sustained load cracking, and stress corrosion cracking. The microstructural condition of finished components depends on the details of billet processing, component forging, and heat treatment practice. The mechanisms of microstructure evolution at each step of the process are summarized and directional guidance is given relative to important factors controlling MTR and alpha colony formation. Laboratory coupon testing, accelerated tests for dwell sensitivity, and aspects of specimen versus component behavior are discussed. Multiple pathways that lead to CDF failure are summarized and strategies to mitigate the risk of CDF are highlighted including aspects of alloy composition, processing/microstructure relationships, design, and nondestructive inspection. This report concludes with identification of directions for further research. Several appendices are provided which summarize major research programs related to CDF and additional methods to characterize MTRs using destructive and nondestructive evaluations methods."],

        "mods.abstract":["The purpose of this project was to provide a data driven process to identify sensor technologies with the potential for detecting and identifying low levels of contaminants that may occasionally be present in aircraft engine bleed air supplies. Bleed air from a ground-based aircraft propulsion engine and an auxiliary power unit (APU) were used to supply air through an ozone/volatile organic compound (VOC) converter to the environmental control system on a Boeing 747, while injecting controlled amounts of fluid contaminants (i.e., aircraft engine oil, hydraulic fluid, and deicing fluid). Measurements of contaminants were performed at the ozone/VOC converter inlet and exit, and at the air conditioning pack exit. Ultrafine particles (UFP) were found to be a sensitive marker for engine oil contamination with measurements at all three locations showing similar, highly elevated UFP concentrations with a mean diameter near 40nm and smaller when the sample stream was cooled to near room temperature. In situ measurements showed that UFPs are generated by condensation and high UFP concentrations were not detected in uncooled bleed air. Oil contamination VOC levels were very low upstream of the ozone/VOC converter at bleed air temperatures up to 220˚C and increased at bleed temperatures of around 315˚C; however, oil contamination VOC levels remained at sub-ppmv levels. Fine particle concentrations also increased with oil contamination at lower bleed air temperatures, but not with temperatures around 315 ˚C. Secondary contaminants including pentanoic acid, heptanoic acid, acetic acid, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde formed in the ozone/VOC converter as the oil aerosol oxidized. Consideration must be given to contaminant deposition within the bleed air system and sample lines as this deposition may lead to delayed responses and contaminant release during temperature transients. Of the sensor technologies assessed, spectrometers provided the best opportunity to detect and identify contaminants. Carbon monoxide (CO) measurements confirmed that CO is not generated in sufficient quantities to be of value as a marker for engine oil or hydraulic fluid contamination of bleed air. CO may be useful as a marker for ingestion of engine exhaust in some cases. However, carbon dioxide (CO2) is a much better marker for engine exhaust ingestion.",

Efforts are focused on testing and analyzing bonded repairs to 40-in x 24-in flat carbon fiber-reinforced composite panels representative of wing skin using the Aircraft Beam Structural Test (ABST) fixture. As part of this program, a feasibility study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of fiber-oriented scarfing in restoring the strength of repaired panels. The term feasibility is used here to assess the practicality of a concept proposed in another study. Fiber-oriented scarf repair is bonded in a way that for every layer, plies are not overlapped in the perpendicular direction to the fiber. As compared to traditional circular scarf repair, fiber-oriented scarf repair has the same number of plies but uses a smaller footprint, reduces the technician skills required to fabricate the scarf using automation, and improves ergonomics and efficiency. Repaired panels with fiber-oriented, tapered, and stepped scarfs were considered in this study. In general, all repair configurations were able to restore strength beyond notched structure capability, which is defined as the strength of a laminate containing a small hole or small damage and is often considered a critical sizing component for primary structures. All fiber-oriented scarf repair panels failed similarly as the traditional scarf repair panels. However, due to the lack of smooth tapering and abrupt termination of ply overlapping in the transverse direction, there was a reduction in strength when compared to tapered (13%) and stepped scarf (4%) repair panels. Fiber-oriented scarf repairs did provide the benefit of precision in material removal and a 40% reduced repair footprint.

Prior research by the FAA to develop best practices for measuring the aircraft noise reduction of building façades resulted in the development of a new SAE Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP) 6973, that provides additional details for application to practical situations. Like its predecessor, ASTM E966, the method requires the use of an outdoor loudspeaker. However, there are situations encountered in the field, such as areas with limited exterior space, where it is difficult to position a loudspeaker or to generate a uniform distribution of sound energy over the test façade. To overcome these limitations, an alternative method for measuring noise reduction has been developed, with a loudspeaker placed inside the house and the noise reduction measured from the inside to the outside. This approach removes restrictions on the placement of an external loudspeaker. A feasibility study of such an indoor-to-outdoor test procedure for measuring noise reduction in buildings demonstrated the equivalence of the results with those of the standard outdoor-to-indoor method. The goal of this project was to further develop the alternative indoor loudspeaker procedure with additional measurements in houses with special conditions, such as those with limited outdoor free space or attached porches, and to incorporate the methods into a revised version of SAE ARP 6973."],

Bleed air from a ground-based aircraft propulsion engine and an auxiliary power unit (APU) were used to supply air through an ozone/volatile organic compound (VOC) converter to the environmental control system on a Boeing 747, while injecting controlled amounts of fluid contaminants (i.e., aircraft engine oil, hydraulic fluid, and deicing fluid). Measurements of contaminants were performed at the ozone/VOC converter inlet and exit, and at the air conditioning pack exit. Ultrafine particles (UFP) were found to be a sensitive marker for engine oil contamination with measurements at all three locations showing similar, highly elevated UFP concentrations with a mean diameter near 40nm and smaller when the sample stream was cooled to near room temperature. In situ measurements showed that UFPs are generated by condensation and high UFP concentrations were not detected in uncooled bleed air. Oil contamination VOC levels were very low upstream of the ozone/VOC converter at bleed air temperatures up to 220˚C and increased at bleed temperatures of around 315˚C; however, oil contamination VOC levels remained at sub-ppmv levels. Fine particle concentrations also increased with oil contamination at lower bleed air temperatures, but not with temperatures around 315 ˚C. Secondary contaminants including pentanoic acid, heptanoic acid, acetic acid, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde formed in the ozone/VOC converter as the oil aerosol oxidized. Consideration must be given to contaminant deposition within the bleed air system and sample lines as this deposition may lead to delayed responses and contaminant release during temperature transients. Of the sensor technologies assessed, spectrometers provided the best opportunity to detect and identify contaminants. Carbon monoxide (CO) measurements confirmed that CO is not generated in sufficient quantities to be of value as a marker for engine oil or hydraulic fluid contamination of bleed air. CO may be useful as a marker for ingestion of engine exhaust in some cases. However, carbon dioxide (CO2) is a much better marker for engine exhaust ingestion."],

          "This master plan outlines the test and evaluation activities required to develop the ARGUS Explosives Detection System (EDS) and the organization required to support that effort. The plan identifies 40 verification requirements, their method of verification, and assignments. The Grantees are responsible for certifying compliance; the program outlined herein formally verifies compliance. That is, regardless of the approach to verification identified in this TEMP for any particular requirement, the vendor is to certify that it has been satisfied prior to any evaluation by the FAA. The FAA will provide further verification of many requirements and, is required by statute, formal certification of specific effectiveness requirements.",
          "The plan identifies seven (7) test and evaluation activities to take the EDS from development testing through system testing and technology transition to a procurement ready status. FAA Certification Testing is an important part of the testing needed because no system can be fielded that has not passed that testing. However, it is only the one of the seven events.  Most of the requirements for the ARGUS EDS are not related to FAA Certification. Most of them apply to the stability of the system for use in its intended operational environment by its intended users in accordance with its established procedures. These suitability requirements address such issues as initial and recurring cost, ease of operation, availability of quality documentation, system reliability and availability, date collection for system assessment and improvement, environmental issues, and safety.",

        "mods.abstract":["Aviation emissions cause global changes in air quality which have been estimated to result in ~58 000 premature mortalities per year, but this number varies by an order of magnitude between studies. The causes of this uncertainty include differences in the assessment of ozone exposure impacts and in how air quality changes are simulated, as well as the possibility that low-resolution (˘400 km) global models may overestimate impacts compared to finer-resolution (˘50 km) regional models. We use the GEOS-Chem High-Performance chemistry-transport model at a 50 km global resolution, an order of magnitude finer than recent assessments of the same scope, to quantify the air quality impacts of aviation with a single internally consistent global approach. We find that aviation emissions in 2015 resulted in 21 200 (95% confidence interval due to health response uncertainty: 19 400–22 900) premature mortalities due to particulate matter exposure and 53 100 (36 000–69 900) due to ozone exposure. Compared to a prior estimate of 6800 ozone-related premature mortalities for 2006 our central estimate is increased by 5.6 times due to the use of updated epidemiological data, which includes the effects of ozone exposure during winter, and by 1.3 times due to increased aviation fuel burn. The use of fine (50 km) resolution increases the estimated impacts on both ozone and particulate-matter-related mortality by a further 20% compared to coarse-resolution (400 km) global simulation, but an intermediate resolution (100 km) is sufficient to capture 98% of impacts. This is in part due to the role of aviation-attributable ozone, which is long-lived enough to mix through the Northern Hemisphere and exposure to which causes 2.5 times as much health impact as aviation-attributable PM2:5. This work shows that the air quality impacts of civil aviation emissions are dominated by the hemisphere-scale response of tropospheric ozone to aviation NOx rather than local changes and that simulations at ˘100 km resolution provide similar results to those at a 2 times finer spatial scale.

        "dc.description.abstract":["Aviation emissions cause global changes in air quality which have been estimated to result in ~58 000 premature mortalities per year, but this number varies by an order of magnitude between studies. The causes of this uncertainty include differences in the assessment of ozone exposure impacts and in how air quality changes are simulated, as well as the possibility that low-resolution (˘400 km) global models may overestimate impacts compared to finer-resolution (˘50 km) regional models. We use the GEOS-Chem High-Performance chemistry-transport model at a 50 km global resolution, an order of magnitude finer than recent assessments of the same scope, to quantify the air quality impacts of aviation with a single internally consistent global approach. We find that aviation emissions in 2015 resulted in 21 200 (95% confidence interval due to health response uncertainty: 19 400–22 900) premature mortalities due to particulate matter exposure and 53 100 (36 000–69 900) due to ozone exposure. Compared to a prior estimate of 6800 ozone-related premature mortalities for 2006 our central estimate is increased by 5.6 times due to the use of updated epidemiological data, which includes the effects of ozone exposure during winter, and by 1.3 times due to increased aviation fuel burn. The use of fine (50 km) resolution increases the estimated impacts on both ozone and particulate-matter-related mortality by a further 20% compared to coarse-resolution (400 km) global simulation, but an intermediate resolution (100 km) is sufficient to capture 98% of impacts. This is in part due to the role of aviation-attributable ozone, which is long-lived enough to mix through the Northern Hemisphere and exposure to which causes 2.5 times as much health impact as aviation-attributable PM2:5. This work shows that the air quality impacts of civil aviation emissions are dominated by the hemisphere-scale response of tropospheric ozone to aviation NOx rather than local changes and that simulations at ˘100 km resolution provide similar results to those at a 2 times finer spatial scale. However, the overall quantification of health impacts is sensitive to assumptions regarding the response of human health to exposure, and additional research is needed to reduce uncertainty in the physical response of the atmosphere to aviation emissions."],
